_root = 
    1 Have the _Approach approach [ , and do _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 The same asanas and practice can be done under different settings, different cultural background. Each has a marked influence on the practice itself and what one gets out of it.
    ! 2 It is quite evident that what one gets out of a practice depends a lot on the mindset and culture influence on one at the time of the practice. Recognizing that and actually trying out doing something with different influences and cultures helps one deepen one’s understanding and learning.
    ! 3 When you do a certain thing with a conscious recognition of the mindset and culture setting under which you are doing it, and in fact actively trying to instate that culture and influences, there is a lateral thinking-like skill being developed, on the practice and on the embodiment aspects.

    3 Closely study the impact and tuning of weight/gravity distribution [ , in _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 The influence of weight and gravity distribution in an asana is one of the most basic infleunces and hence very worthy of study. It affects a range of things like the skeleto-muscular configuration, muscular action, organic body configuration and blood circulation.
    ! 2 The various actions and corrections in asanas, be it extending, hardening, softening, twisting, can be viewed in terms of shifting the weight and gravity centers. Practising with close attention on this view gives many new insights into the various asanas and helps one learn better.
    ! 3 Many of the uses of props can be seen in the light of managing the weight and gravity distribution when the body itself is not capable of it, or when some of that role needs to be offloaded to props to be able to focus on other aspects in an asana.
    ! 4 Experimenting with shifting of weight and gravity distribution back and forth, while in an asana, gives us lessons in the dynamics of a pose.
    ! 5 Weight and gravity distribution is of great importance not only in an asana but also in the stages of going into the asana and coming out of it. So that's another mode of study.

    5 Study where and how you can apply a lock / mudra [ , in _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 Applying a mudra / lock at a certain area in a pose, means bringing it into position and applying a lock there so to speak, so that it is held in that position without having to apply constant muscular action to hold it there. Doing this increases the efficacy of the pose, and greatly helps one stay in the pose for a long duration.
    ! 2 When a mudra / lock is applied at the right body-area for a pose, there is no need for constant effort to hold the position. This frees up one's effort, both physical and mental, so that it can be applied to other and deeper aspects. Lessening this effort can be seen as a first step in the direction of prayatna shaithilya.
    ! 3 Applying a mudra / lock brings great efficacy to the pose and especially in holding it. An example is to quickly go to vrikshasana and observe the shakiness, unsteadiness and need for effort to get balance (unless of course, one has spent a lot of time habitually getting steady in it; in which case try a different pose involving balance). Now apply a mudra / lock at wrists of the raised and joined hands, or even better at the knuckles (if you can). Observe how the pose becomes immediately steady and can be held for a long time.
    ! 4 While applying a mudra / lock lends great efficacy and helps one stay in and study a pose, one needs to develop the skill to understand where to apply the mudra / lock in which asana. Identifying this not only improves the asana, but also develops insights into it. Mudra / lock may also get applied at the wrong place. As an example, in the raised hand of trikonasana, applying mudra / lock at the upper arm / elbow is not right. It also locks in the flow of awareness / energy which should ideally flow through the elbow to the top of the hand. So applying it at the wrist or knuckles is the right place.
    ! 5 A mudra or lock can be applied at several body parts, and one has to find the appropriate places for an asana in question. The commonly considered locking regions are knee and elbow joints, but other effective locking regions include the wrist, ankles and even knuckles. Furthermore, mudra may be applied at regions like the shoulder-blade, shoulders, neck, the upper, mid or lower spine, as well as the tail bone and hip joints. Considering mudras at these areas to see whether they are appropriate for various asanas, helps deepen understanding of asanas.
    ! 6 Often there is benefit in effecting an evacuation in the area, usually by exhalation, prior to applying a lock - this leads to a much more effective lock. The farther the region of lock the finer the breath required for the evacuation. An analogy is of a house, where unwanted things need to be thrown out and required things brought in before locking it. In this case, unwanted things may be things like dullness, wavering, unwillingness etc. and the welcome things would be neutrality, sublimity etc. The evacuation process prior to the lock helps in this regard.

    7 Study what about the asana is common with which other asanas, when doing _AsanaDescriptor
    ! 1 Finding common elements among asanas means in a sense also finding variously defined groups that this asana can be a member of. Such thinking helps understand the big picture underlying the variety of asanas, and being able to identify where this particular asana fits into the big picture.
    ! 2 When identifying what is common between an asana and other asanas, one may consider a category such as standing poses, or see whether a body part (say, the foot or the shoulder-blade) is in a similar profile or role, or look for commonality in things like the effect on the organic body, or the natural breath profile for the asana, or even the mind states, effects and gestures that may be the point of commonality.
    ! 3 While working on identifying commonality, one discovers that asanas that are seemingly quite different from the outside, may have key points of commonality on the inside, like in organic system, breath or mind aspects. Also, asanas may be found to be largely different, but yet common in some very specific thing like the foot position or the role of the neck. Such findings give insights into asanas as well as the joy of finding this out.
    8 Study what about the asana is different from which other asanas, when doing _AsanaDescriptor
    ! 1 An identity of something is a lot about how it is different from everything else. So thinking and learning about in what ways a given asana is different from other asanas, helps us learn about what is special about the asana.
    ! 2 Often it is straightforward to identify how a given asana is different from other asanas of an entirely different categories. Yet identifying the specifics helps learn more about the asana. Even more insights can be obtained from contrasting an asana from other asanas in the same set and those that are similar in many aspects. This helps brings out the subtler uniqueness about the asana.
    ! 3 Identifying what is different about a given asana from other asanas involves thinking about various aspects like the posture, the skeleto-muscular body, the organic system, as well as breath and mind profiles. This helps develop a strong understanding of not just this asana, but about the entire embodiment and asana set, and leads to newer and newer insights.
    ! 4 Other than broadly categorizing what is different about a given asana, one can also narrow the focus to a certain body part, or a body aspect like skeleto-muscular or organic system, or specific breath interactions. Narrowing the focus can help one go deeper in the understanding of that area.
    9 Study _AsanaPhase [ for _AsanaComponent ] [ , and do _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 The journey of an asana starts from the thought of doing the asana to the point you are out of that asanas, with effects still lingering. Those effects will manifest in subsequent asanas, and in fact the mind effects may last beyond that into the daily life as well.
    ! 2 It is very instructive to be very conscious of the mind, body and breath states right from the point where you plan to get into an asana, to the point where you come out of it. There is purpose at the beginning and a learning in the end. The body goes from one condition (ranging from eager and energetic to lethargic and unwilling) to an eventual condition. Concentrating on each phase from going into the pose, being in the asana, to coming out of it, is key to properly understanding the asana.
    ! 3 An asana goes from deciding to do it, actually going into the pose, striking in the pose, staying in it, and coming out of it. Each of it is an area of study, and has an effect on other aspects. Very often however, only the striking-the-pose phase is one of focus and others are overlooked.

    13 Focus on the sentence "I Am Doing This Asana", by emphasizing one-by-one "I", "Am Doing", and "This Asana" [ , and finally end with the karamayoga attitude of "This Asana is Done on Me" ] [ , when doing _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 In ancient Indian thought, there is great attention to language and grammar, and almost no distinction is drawn between the word and the object denoted - they are two manifestations of the same underlying concept, as it were.  Secondly, a direct correlation is recognised between language and mind-making. The given statement is an example of how delving deeper on language and grammar helps cultivate our understanding.
    ! 2 Emphasizing individual parts of the given sentence involves thinking about and characterising it. For example, when emphasizing "I", it can be done at various levels. One's notion of "I" at a given time may be body-centric (eg. tired, stiff), or be mind-centric (eg. bored, enthusiastic, serene), or may be even philosophical in terms of seeking the ""essential I". Thinking about it, helps characterise the doer or subjective entity at the time, to be able to study how it relates to the experience during that practice.
    ! 3 Each part of the sentence focuses on a different aspect. When emphasizing "Am doing", one thinks about the process and actions. What are the individual actions as well as what is the overall approach. This part of the given sentence helps one characterise the acts, and also get a grasp of the overall action as a whole. In some sense, it also can seemingly slow down time as each little act is observed and understood.
    ! 4 Emphasizing and understanding individual aspects of the given sentence gives a more complete understanding of the practice. When emphasizing "the Asana" one must think specifically about the asana being done. One can do that for example by understanding the general characteristics it shares with the group of asanas it is a member of, as well as special characteristics that apply uniquely to it. One can also think about the asana in terms of the body, organs, breath, mind, culture etc.
    ! 5 The karmayogic way of stating it would be "the Asana is done on me". In the karmayogic approach, the sense of self is subdued, the desire for fruit / consequence is renounced, yet actions and duties continue to be performed in spirit of surrender to the Lord. The key disposition for that is one of Witnessivity or Saakshibhaava. This is what the sentence helps to cultivate.

    15 Have _AsanaComponent as the regulator, and _AsanaComponent as the regulated [ , when doing _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 The regulator-regulated aspect is a bit subtle and marks a starting point towards deeper understanding. It is different from just control. In regulation, the thing being regulated is not quite being controlled. It is an autonomous entity operating on its own, and the regulator only provides some amount of guidelines and channeling so that it is acting within proper and effective bounds. The regulator and regulated might be any component such as a body part or aspect, breath component or mind aspects.
    ! 2 The regulator-regulated pair is different from just actor-acted upon pair. In the case of regulation, both components in the pair are playing their roles autonomously, and it is in the fine tuning of this role and action that the regulator applies constraints and channeling, so that it is within effective bounds. The regulator and regulated might be any component such as a body part or aspect, breath component or mind aspects.
    ! 3 Identifying the regulator and regulated, and what is the regulation that is applicable is a good way to deeper understand the purpose of the various acts as well as the necessary skills to strike that purpose. The fact that the regulation only involves channelising helps the regulating and regulated aspects evolve by themselves, and yet have one make sure that the other is still effective while mostly autonomous. The regulator and regulated might be any component such as a body part or aspect, breath component or mind aspects.
    ! 4 Regulation implies channelising towards what's right and about avoiding excesses - either too little or too much.
    ! 5 The key attributes of a regulator entity are wisdom and empathy, so that the regulator can guide towards the right path while appreciating the core nature of what's being regulated.
    ! 6 The key attributes of a regulated entity (regulatee, so to speak) would be enthusiasm, maturity, and willingness to listen.

    17 Have _AsanaComponent as the benefactor, and _AsanaComponent as the beneficiary [ , when doing _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 Benefactor is one who is doing good for another, and the beneficiary is one who is receiving that good. In asanas, different components can play benefactor and beneficiary roles at different times. For example, the body (as benefactor) may make internal adjustments in order to help breath (as beneficiary) flow smoothly, or breath (as benefactor) may work with sharp focus on a body region (the beneficiary) to increase bodily efficacy and penetration. 
    ! 2 Developing, studying and understanding the benefactor-beneficiary relationship with different aspects of the embodiment helps inculcate an internal culture that transforms and uplifts even in day-to-day life.
    ! 3 The wonderful thing is that the benefactor-beneficiary relationship is not as one-sided as it may appear at first glance. The benefactor itself also derives substantial benefit through its action, and the beneficiary also ends up contributing to the betterment of the benefactor. For example, when a body adjustment is made for the benefit of breath, such as smoother unimpeded flow, one can observe that the body itself is also greatly benefited by the adjustment and the access it generates.

    19 Study the Actor, the Action, and the Acted upon [ , when doing _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 Every act is said to be constituted of the triad of the actor, the action, and the one that is acted upon. Focusing on understanding these three constituents, helps understanding the act better. Each of the constituents could be anything like a body part, or a breath or mind aspect too.
    ! 2 When doing an asana, some acts are conscious and deliberate, some happen through habit and practice, and some happen as responses from the embodiment. Understanding these are essential to better understanding the asana. Identifying the actor, action and acted upon (each of which could be something like a body part, or a breath or mind aspect), helps one understand the act itself.
    ! 3 Identifying the actor, action and acted upon can be subtle. For example for the common instruction “open the chest”, the actor could be the shoulder blades, the frontal chest, the side chest or an inhalation, or an exhalation; the action could be a widening, a lengthening, or expanding the frontal dome; and the acted upon could be the sternum, the diaphragm, or even the breath. Just thinking through this helps gain insights that deepen the understanding of the embodiment and the asana methodology.

    21 Study the Knower, the Knowledge and Knowledge-process, and the Known [ , when doing _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 Yogic philosophy and Indian thought in general, gives a great deal of importance in understanding the subjective processes involved in knowing and understanding. The inward journey consists of subtler and inner layers where each is said to be the knower of the outer one.
    ! 2 Trying to understanding the knower-knowing-known triad helps one learn about learning itself. The triad is all-encompassing for the understanding process and gives lends maturity to observation and inference.
    ! 3 Knowers can be at different levels. For example, sometimes we find that a physical body part seems to have learnt a certain action, or breath gives some new access, or the mind uncovers a certain new discovery as a result of an asanic kriya, whereas sometimes the intelligence is able to reason why a certain process leads to a certain effect. Understanding the knower helps one grow in maturity.
    ! 4 The knowledge and knowledge-process is the means by which the knower makes and observation or draws an inference. Being able to recognise and articulate this knowledge-process lends rigor and thoroughness to one’s understanding of asana practice.
    ! 5 The Known can be an entity like a body part or a phenomenon like an effect of a certain kriya in a certain context. Learning to pinpoint the known is a sign of growing understanding.
    ! 6 The learning could sometimes start by fixing the prospective Knower and let the discovery process take its course, or fixing an action and let the Knower and Known emerge, or on the other hand fixing the Known and trying to gain knowledge of it. Each unravels new understanding in its own way.

    ! 4 The knowledge and knowledge-process is the means by which the knower makes and observation or draws an inference. Being able to recognise and articulate this knowledge-process lends rigor and thoroughness to one’s understanding of asana practice.
    ! 5 The Known can be an entity like a body part or a phenomenon like an effect of a certain kriya in a certain context. Learning to pinpoint the known is a sign of growing understanding.
    ! 6 The learning could sometimes start by fixing the prospective Knower and let the discovery process take its course, or fixing an action and let the Knower and Known emerge, or on the other hand fixing the Known and trying to gain knowledge of it. Each unravels new understanding in its own way.    
    23 Study Actions and Responses [ , when doing _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 Often the process of doing an asana is conceived as just doing one action after another, and then one correction after another. The key to learning however, lies in seeing how the embodiment is responding.
    ! 2 Actions may be of various types - skeleto-muscular, organic body based, or breath based; and so are the responses. In fact, one kind of action begets responses of all types. To begin with though the primary responses should be observed and studied.
    ! 3 The same action in the same asana does not necessarily lead to the same response. Responses depend also on the condition of the body and mind at the time. Hence learning the common response, and the particular variation at the time, helps develop more subjective insight.
    ! 4 Contrary to expectation, you will often find that responses in so-called subtler aspects viz. organs and breath, is more readily evident than responses in grosser aspects of bones and muscles. Hence study of responses is an ready road for start going inward.
    ! 5 It is interesting that you find that responses are more pronounced and evident, when the action is more subtle and mild. Hence small refinements in subtle areas - not just in body, but in breath, senses and even the mind; can bring bring forth responses that reveal the structure, internal geometry and connected richness of the embodiment.
    ! 6 Responses worth studying require time. This means having enough time for practice, to bring yourself to a state of preparedness. It also means leaving enough time between actions rather than having a barrage of actions all come together in succession.

    42 Put your mind-state in the driver's seat, and see how it influences your acts and engenders a purpose [ , as you do _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 When people practice asanas, they usually work on getting into the pose, stretching, elongating, expanding, or whatever, and effectively forcing all the unwilling parts to fall in line and strike the pose. One approach to learn however, is to let the current state of mind (whether lazy or willing) be in charge, and observe what purpose is created - whether release, exercise, rest, or rejuvenation, and how the embodiment acts in accordance.
    ! 2 Directly starting with the mind-state in the driver’s seat prevents any preparatory conditioning, and prevents the conscious mind-brain from interfering with how the asana unravels itself. So both the acts and the emergent purpose are completely natural to that condition. This is worthy of study to understand oneself.
    ! 3 The current mind-state could be anything ranging from tired and unwilling, to serene or zealous. It can also be characterized using sattva, rajas, tamas parameters. One needs to observe the purpose that it naturally engenders which could be physical exercise, internal study, relaxation and release etc. The acts then follow accordingly and may be to do with bodily actions, breath, mind or senses. The idea is to closely study these things that emerge, without conscious conditioning.

    46 Study efficacy due to breath on actions. Perfom all actions and corrections _TimeRelation _BreathComponent2 focused on that specific region of action [ , as you do _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 Breath has almost a magic touch. When breath is associated with an action it helps in a number of ways. It can make the action more effective, and it also increases the ability to sense and study the action itself along with corresponding objects like body parts that are acted upon. Associating breath could be in ways like exhalation, inhalation, retention, before or after those, as well as various parameters (like duration, volume) of each of those.
    ! 2 Associating breath with actions, not only makes it more effective and helps you sense and study the action better, it also makes that result of the action sustainable. An action made by associating breath with it in a certain way, is more natural to maintain for a length of time, compared to action involving skeleto-muscular aspects alone.
    ! 3 Associating breath with action involves deploying breath in that area of action - whether shoulder blade, chest, abdomen, limbs etc. This is a basic skill that must be learnt, and asanas help one learn this. One can then go further and deploy different kinds of breath in the region - ranging from sharp to rarefied, as well as do it with inhalation, exhalation, or retention, where each will have a very distinct and clearly discernible effect.
    ! 4 When associating breath with action, recognizing what kind of breath is appropriate is a skill that must be developed. Some actions may require a sharp exhalation in the region along with the quick action, while another may require a steady inhalation along with gradual action. To develop a sense of this, a good way is to actually deploy different kinds of breath in that region for the same action, and observed the effects closely.

    48 Establish a breath cycle, and do/pace all actions and corrections so that the breath cycle remains absolutely undisturbed [ , as you do _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 Most commonly people perform actions and corrections in their asanas just through skeleto-muscular actions. Others develop the skill to deploy their breath in specific areas and in specific ways in order to increase the efficacy of those actions. The approach in this problem statement goes in the opposite direction, by focusing on keeping the breath cycle constant, but is much more subtle and deeper.
    ! 2 Once a breath cycle is established, the idea is to make all movements and corrections with no disturbance of the breath cycle. The helps you learn making movements with absolutely no jerks and jolts, since any small jerk will disturb the breath cycle.
    ! 3 Making actions and movements without disturbing the breath cycle, needs a very specific skill of timing the movements and actions, or even doing it in phases, so that they align with the part of the breath cycle suitable for it. For example, where a certain action is done along with exhalation, you have to wait for that part of the cycle. If this is a longer action, it may have to be split into multiple phases with each one executed when the constant breath cycle enters that exhalation phase.
    ! 4 When initially trying this approach, it is best to establish a breath cycle, in terms of its region, duration and volume, that is conducive for that particular asana. For example, some difficult asanas may have a shorter duration breath more natural to them. Hence working in this mode also improves the skill of knowing the suitable breath cycle upfront.
    ! 5 The approach of staying in a pose, and making movements or corrections, such that the breath cycle is undisturbed, involves skill not only in the body and breath, but also in the mind. Any mind fluctuation or exertion disturbs the breath, and hence the focus on not disturbing the breath automatically leads to a steady mind with inherent neutrality.

    50 Objectify your mind (manas) and intellect (buddhi). _InessSeparation  [ , as you do _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 One way of objectifying the mind and buddhi is to observe it as though from the outside and characterise it, somewhat like how you would characterise the state of your hands and legs (say). The characterisation could be in terms of its sattva, raja, tama tendencies at the time, or mental states and activities like thought and cognition, or emotional states as well.
    ! 2 Asana and pranayama practice is very suitable as the environment and conditions to learn how to objectify the mind and buddhi. In asana and pranayama, there is heightened awareness of the embodiment and its components viz. body, breath, mind and senses; and an inward vision free from outside distractions. The transformations on the components are being sensed and observed, and hence it becomes a natural progression to free the sense of self from the mind to make it an object of awareness. Once that ability is developed in an asana environment, one is able to deploy it in day to day life, radically transforming once abilities to deal with difficult life situations.
    ! 3 Objectifying the mind implies looking at or treating the mind as though it is an object (as opposed to  the subject) of awareness. For example, we say things like "this hand", "my hair", where the hand and hair are just objects. We similarly look at the mind from the outside as it were. This skill, to be able to objectify the mind when required, can be the beginning of almost magical transformations , not just in yoga practice, but even in everyday life situations.
    ! 4 Making the mind an object of awareness does not necessarily imply closely observing and characterising it. Another mode is to make it an object of awareness and yet not emphasize it through special attention or close observation,  and instead treat it in a de-emphasized manner like any other object (eg. fingers and toes), thus detaching the subjective consciousness and taking it farther away from the phenomenal mind.

    ! 2 When breath is a beneficiary of the body, the culture of breath is not so much to cause specific actions or effects, but to revel in the smooth flow kindly enabled for it by the body by opening up constrictions and creating a wide highway for it.
    ! 3 When breath is a benefactor for the body, it makes very specific inhalations and exhalations, in the right regions with the right velocity, co-ordinated with bodily actions, so that those actions become more effective. For example, a sharp exhalation evacuating the should-blade region, enabling an effective Bharadwajasana turn.
    ! 4 When body is a beneficiary of breath, its culture is to respond to the deployed breath, by high breath sensitivity, co-ordinating actions with breath movement, and amplifying effects such as evacuation through exhalation or energizing through inhalation etc. that the breath brings in.
    ! 5 Body and breath have a very specific culture when playing the role of benefactor or beneficiary. Each of the combinations automatically has a distinct influence on their mind. For example, when the body as a benefactor opens internally to allow smooth flow of breath, the mind has an ocean-like steadiness and expansive culture; whereas when the breath as the benefactor is deployed in specific regions, with specific velocity to help bodily action, the mind becomes sharp, attuned to the pose with high awareness.

    54 Study mind-breath corelation. [ While in _AsanaDescriptor , ] Imagine and fully pretend having a _MindState . Now closely observe the breath. Go back to normal. Next breathe in that same manner, and see if it engenders that same mind state
    ! 1 It is almost magical to recognise how closely related breath and mind are. Not only that, it appears that this can be investigated in either direction. This gives us the wonderful mechanism whereby to identify the breath to engender a mind-state, you get into the mind-state and identify the breath corresponding to it. This breath can be characterised in terms of duration, volume, and region of exhalation and inhalation component. Then after a reset of mind-state if you breathe in that manner, you see that mind-state emerge almost magically.
    ! 2 We can map the breath corresponding to different mind-states. Once we understand the breath that corresponds to different mind-states, we have the power to work on our mind-state not just peripherally or psychologically, but internally and autogenically by establishing the corresponding breath and see the mind-state emerge. This prepares us to tackle various life situations, by being able to approach them with the required mind-state.
    ! 3 Carefully figuring out the breath corresonding to different mind-states help us understand the essential features of different breath configurations. Eventually this enables us to no longer be at the mercy of mind and mood, but be in control. That too not by stressful attempts to control the mind through conscious thinking (which will invariably be tainted by current state of mind), but by breath which is essentially neutral and something untouched by our embodiment’s vicissitudes.

    56 [ As you do _AsanaDescriptor , ] Study the skin and body parts that touch the ground. Are they even or uneven? Why so? 
    ! 1 The parts touching the ground - be they palms, feet, or back, are an indicator of the position and alignment of the rest of the body, the superstructure. Being sensitive to the minute details of the parts touching the ground, where is it even or uneven, where stretched or contracted, etc. can help point out problems in the superstructure which otherwise might seem to have been completely set right.
    ! 2 The parts touching the ground in an asana, are like a compressed indicator of all the variations in the alignment and configuration of the rest of the body. Trying to set these parts and their contact with the ground right, often requires corrections and changes in multiple regions far removed from there. Hence having action and corrections focussed on setting right the parts touching the ground, is one way to understand things the interconnectedness of the embodiment, and the non-obvious errors and corrections required.
    ! 3 Looking at the evenness, unevenness, stretch, contraction of the parts touching the ground is one way to understand whether everything in the superstructure that seems right is really so. In addition, when doing an asana, the parts touching the ground can be made so that they either push into the ground or pull away from the ground.Notice how big a difference it makes to the asana if you try to change from one to the other even though the asana may look the same from outside.
    ! 4 When working on breath penetration it often happens that the parts touching the ground get neglected because they have lesser freedom of movement (since a surface is in contact with the floor). Attempting to get the breath penetration reach the parts touching the ground is one way to build greater skills and insights into breath penetration focus.

    58 Study the propagation of muscular action over body parts. Imagine musculature as an elastic band stretching from your big toe, along the sole, over the heel, calf, thigh, up over the hips and spine up to the neck. [ As you do _AsanaDescriptor , ] make movements in your _ElasticBandArea ,  to separately stretch, relax, and widen the elastic band, and study its impacts on other parts of the elastic band (musculature)
    ! 1 Muscular action is among the first things that the attention of a yoga student gets drawn too. Hence studying the propagation of muscular action is important to gain proficiency.
    ! 2 It always helps to have a model of the thing you want to study, and then work with the model to improve your understanding. In this case, a simple model of an elastic band stretching from end to end works as a great model to understand bodily actions, muscular responses and resistances, as various actions are done. It also helps observe how actions such as stretching or loosening/contracting in one area, or in the front/back side can have an effect in another area, either helping perform the asana more easily, or facing more resistance.
    ! 3 The model of an elastic band is a good approximation of all the details of musculature that pulls and pushes either along or against the action you wish to do. The elastic band should be considered to not just stretch along its length, but also as a wide band that expands along its breadth.

    60 Pay attention to _AsanaActor first in _AsanaDescriptor , and then again in _AsanaDescriptor . Study the key differences between the two cases
    ! 1 Different asanas are obviously different on a peripheral plane, and yet when you observe what it takes to perform the same act and how the embodiment responds, you get far clearer and deeper insights into the characteristics of the asana related to the act.
    ! 2 Relating and differentiating between different asanas in relation to a constant focus-factor, teaches one about that focus-factor, the asanas in question, and also builds a wider perspective encompassing multiple asanas and how they relate to each other.
    ! 3 Focusing on the same body region or the same skeleto-muscular act in different contexts helps build an understanding of that region and act, of its possible roles in different configurations, and also a better understanding of the asanas in question. 
    ! 4 Focusing on an organic body region or action in different asanas builds an understanding of the organic role in the asanas, and also on the effect on the mind-state of that organ focus. It also builds an understanding of the therapeutic implications of the asana from the perspective of bodily organs.
    ! 5 When the same breath action is done in different asanas and compared, a wonderful deep insight is gained on how the asanas have an effect on the breath interplay with the internal body, and on the response of the embodiment to that breath action.
    ! 6 If the focus is made on the same aspect of the mind-stuff in different asanas, an understanding of the underlying and inherent mental disposition, gesture and culture of the asana is gained. This is of importance in studies on the yogic aspects of the asana.

    ! 1 Thinking of and doing other asanas with a similar profile for a body part is a good way to understand the asanas as well as the body part better.
    ! 2 Thinking of other asanas related by similarities will enable devising sequences that act on an area in a coherent manner.
    ! 3 The ability to think of other asanas while working on one, with a common thread running across them, is a good way to build a certain breadth of perspective.

    66 While doing _AsanaDescriptor , Observe the _BodyPart profile. Think of which other asanas have an almost opposite profile. What can we learn about this body part from studying the asanas that generate such different profiles of it?
    ! 1 Our body parts can have several different positions and profiles (eg. lenghtened, expanded, twist, hardened, softened etc.), and the wide range of asanas help us understand that. Thinking of a body part at a time, and the asanas the take them into opposite profiles, helps one get an insight into the overall range of profiles for that part. It also helps get insights on the asanas themselves.
    ! 2 A key aspect of understanding a body part of region is in understanding its connectivity and influence on the other body parts - especially the neighbouring ones, but eventually also the farther ones. Just as the profile of a body part changes in different asanas with inherent actions like stretching, softening etc., there is a significant difference in its connectivity with other parts. Try to understand this as you focus on the same body part, but in asanas that have it in very different profiles.
    ! 3 Body parts and regions have a physical profile, but in the yogic model they also have a mindset and culture of their own. A broad categorisation of this could be made in terms of sattva, raja, tama attributes. As one focuses on a given body part, but in asanas chosen to put them in very different profile, one can try and understand how that changes the mindset and culture of the body part, as opposed to just its physical profile.

    68 Study _Joints in the role of the locus of movement, and also the opposite role of the locus of mudra / lock [ , as you do _AsanaDescriptor ]
    ! 1 Joints are essentially the fulcrum in any movement, and one can study the range, accessibility and even preferred sequence in joint movements for an asana. At the same time it is amazing how it is at the joints that one can make a lock to reduce muscular strain while in a pose, thereby enabling one to stay in the pose for a long time.
    ! 2 Different joints have a different extent of participation in the movements required to attain a pose. It is instructive to learn the involvement of different joints for this in different as asanas. Similarly, for different asanas, there are key joints that need to be locked into position to enable the associated musculature to be able to stay in the pose without too much fatigue.
    ! 3 In different asanas, certain joints need to support a lot of movement while others let the movement flow through them without undergoing too much movement in themselves. Similarly, certain joints need to be completely locked into position to be able to maintain an asana, while others should let the energy flow through them without a lock. It is marvellous how the range asanas enable joints to go through all these roles.

    72 [ As you do _AsanaDescriptor , ] Investigate retention duration. Repeat [ _BreathRegion ] _RetentionDescriptor , increasing the duration each time. Find out at which point this starts leading to negative effects rather than a positive effect. Stop at this point, and recover.
    ! 1 As you increase retention duration and make observations, you a really working in the inner realm with almost no activity happening, total silence, and focus almost entirely on responses than on voluntary action. Hence this mode of study has many characteristics of essential yoga.
    ! 2 As you make observations with increasing retention duration, you may find things happening which you never anticipated. For example, you may find uddiyana kriya automatically taking place even though you are not actively initiating it. These observations help learn some essential body processes and responses.
    ! 3 Specifying a region for retention doesn’t seem to make sense at first glance since retention does not involve a specific activity like inhalation and exhalation do, and in fact is sort of a cessation of activity. Normally, when a region is specified for retention, it can be taken as the region for the breath-phase (inhalation or exhalation as the case may be) preceding that retention.
    ! 4 In Yoga practice, one often has a mindset of doing as much as possible or staying as long as possible etc. Gradually increasing the duration of retention, over repeated attempts as mentioned here, helps one achieve that more organically and systematically.

    ! 7 At some point, the implicit effort of replicating becomes too much for the embodiment, unless one is very advanced. At this point, the transformations turn to be negative, and could be in the body (eg. pain), breath (sporadic breath setting in) or mind (strong urge to stop). The idea is to develop oneself so that this point comes later and later.

    ! 3 Replicating the same act is a separate skill from constant corrections and improvements. It needs greater refinement in the practitioner.
    ! 4 Replicating implies a certain periodicity and hence focusing on breath-cycles in order to make each cycle a replica of the previous one is a suitable way to approach this.
    ! 5 Replication means keeping things the same, but in order to do that there are various subtle actions and corrections required to counter voluntary and involuntary forces that takes the body or mind in a different direction.
    ! 6 The beauty of studying parinama by replicating the same act lies in the fact that the voluntary act is focused on keeping things the same, but observations indicate transformations setting in as things simply seem to happen by themselves. These transformations are towards greater suitability towards for deeper yogic practices.
    ! 7 At some point, the implicit effort of replicating becomes too much for the embodiment, unless one is very advanced. At this point, the transformations turn to be negative, and could be in the body (eg. pain), breath (sporadic breath setting in) or mind (strong urge to stop). The idea is to develop oneself so that this point comes later and later.    
    77 As you do _AsanaDescriptor , Try to set right the lower and mid trunk using skeleto-muscular actions. Do again, but this time doing [ _UddiyanaDesc ] Uddiyana-Kriya instead. Observe how the efficacy of the latter approach is of a higher degree.
    ! 1 Setting right using skeleto-muscular actions involves things like lengthening, flattening, straightening etc. at appropriate areas. This is not easy to orchestrate. One encounters bodily resistance and often it leads to an adverse effect on the position of other body parts, or on the breath. On the other hand, uddiyana kriya has a wonderful act with a single focus - that of emptying of breath, retention, and suction. In this kriya, the necessary muscular actions for setting right simply fall into place. Hence the setting-right effect of uddiyana kriya is more auto-generated and inwardly.
    ! 2 When the trunk is set right through skeleto-muscular actions, it is rather difficult to hold the state and stay for some time in it. When it is set right vy uddiyana kriya however, it is much more natural to maintain the effects, and to cyclically repeat the kriya in co-ordination with breath.
    ! 3 Setting right using skeleto-muscular actions is limited in efficacy, and it either does not reach the organic body sufficiently, or if forced, can even have an adverse effect on them. Uddiyana kriya has a direct and discernible nourishing effect on the organs, and moreover, the skeleto-muscular corrections just fall into place, and the kriya goes deeper still.
    ! 4 Just like there is a variety of skeleto-muscular acts like lengthening, flattening, stretching etc., there is a variety of uddiyana kriyas involving at the basic level, uddiyana along with inhalation or exhalation, or after inhalation or exhalation etc., and at a more refined level involving various breath characteristics, breath regions, and breath shapes.

    79 As you do _AsanaDescriptor , study Uddiyana-kriyas in terms of effect on _UddiyanaEffectOn . First do _UddiyanaDesc Uddiyana-kriya and then again _UddiyanaDesc Uddiyana-kriya, and compare the subtle differences between the two cases.
    ! 1 Uddiyana-kriya can be done in different modes or phases of breath such as with or along exhalation or inhalation, as post-exhalative exhalation etc. While these are all indeed Uddiyana-kriya, each is very distinctive in its experience and effects.
    ! 2 Comparing different modes of Uddiyana-kriya, helps understand the kriya as a whole as well as each of the modes by itself. This is a very effective way of learning.
    ! 3 When comparing different modes of Uddiyana-kriya, it is not just the breath experience to compare. There is also a very strong involvement of the muscular and organic body, close involvement of the mind, and a rich and unified auto-genic experience which cannot be easily separated as that of breath, body or mind.

    81 [ As you do _AsanaDescriptor , ] Study a specific mode of stretching, in terms of both, the process and the effect. _StretchMode
    82 As you do _AsanaDescriptor , Study a specific mode of stretching, in terms of both, the process and the effect. _StretchMode
    83 As you do _SingleAsana with focus on _BodyPart for all awareness and activity, also imagine doing _SingleAsana with the same focus, and think over how that experience relates in its similarity and differences.
    ! 1 As you do one asana, imagining another asana with a certain point of focus builds a certain type of broad and lateral thinking that is useful to generate deeper insights.
    ! 2 A lot of progress comes from understanding relationships and interconnectedness in hitherto unconnected areas. Trying to think about another asana with a certain point of focus while doing some other asanas, opens up opportunities for such progress.
    ! 3 When doing one asana, imagining someone doing another with the same focus and thinking what they are experiencing, is an interesting mix of experience of one action with intellection of another which automatically leads to insights.
    84 As you do go into, do, and come out of _AsanaDescriptor , when making any movements (or major corrections) , focus on the root and not the shoot (eg. on the hip or root of the thigh rather than the foot when turning the leg ). 
    ! 1 Often movements and corrections are described in terms of peripheral body parts (eg. turn the foot), whereas the action is more effective when begun from the root (eg. turning the leg by focusing on and starting with the root of the thigh and taking the action up to the foot).
    ! 2 Focusing on the root when making actions and corrections helps learn the connectedness of the body system from the corresponding root to the shoot.
    ! 3 For proper alignment across the length of the body part, working with an awareness of the root of the action teaches you a great deal.    
    85 As you do _AsanaDescriptor , study what is the natural breathing for the pose when you do not explicitly condition it. Observe atleast the duration, volume, and region.
    ! 1 Just as everybody knows the body position of each asana, one should know that each asana has its own natural breath profile. Identifying that breath profile, is an essential part of understanding the asana.
    ! 2 Just as there is a range of bodily actions applicable to an asana, there is also a range of possible breath actions. And yet, there is a natural breath fingerprint that comes in an asana when no specific action is instated. Learning this breath profile for each asana expands one's repertoire of asanic knowledge and also helps find a whole new set of linkages between asanas.
    ! 3 Often, the choice of asanas to do, is made based on physical condition of the practitioner, the desired state, and the body position of the asana to help getting there. Similarly, there is a whole different plane - that of breath, that can characterise asanas and be a factor in choice of asanas for a desired body or mind effect. Knowing the natural breath profile of an asana is a first step in developing this ability.
    ! 4 The natural breath of an asana is a part of the identity of the asana for a given practitioner. This natural breath needs to be closely understood. Describing the breath in concrete terms like region, duration and volume, is the first basic description before one learns to identify the subtler aspects.
    86 As you do _AsanaDescriptor , focus on _BodyPartsOnly . Make it so that all action and awareness is _EmanationConvergence . Observe how this has an distinctive effect of the profile of the pose in terms of body , mind , breath.
    ! 1 NO HINTS    
    87 As you do _AsanaDescriptor , try attending to the entire embodiment (from tips of fingers, to the ends of toes) to do a so-called complete pose. Again do the same, but this time with complete focus on one region - the _BreathRegion , while allowing the inherent connectivity of the embodiment to cater to the rest of it.  Compare the marked difference between the two in terms of the culture of the mind, the body, the breath and the pose.
    ! 1 Actually attending to the entire embodiment (from tips of fingers to the ends of toes) all at one time is not possible for most people. What we often end up doing is to attend to different areas at different times, thereby having a moving awareness. On the other hand, when focusing completely on one region the mind and awareness is centered, and connectivity allows one to spread the awareness from that point.    
    ! 2 Complete focus on one region allows for deeper penetration and understanding, primarily with respect to that region but spreading further from that point. On the other hand, trying to attend to the various points in the embodiment leads to shifting awareness which leads to only shallow penetration in the regions.
    ! 3 The deepened awareness in one region spreads around it through the inherent connectivity in the embodiment. On the other hand, trying to bring awareness to the various different body parts and ends is a discontinuous jump from one to another. Doing and comparing the two, helps one gain greater insight into that connectivity itself.
    88 As you do _AsanaDescriptor , do it with complete focus on one region - the _BreathRegion region , while allowing the inherent connectivity of the embodiment to cater to the rest of it. Again do the same with complete focus on the _BreathRegion .  Study the difference between the two in terms of the culture of the mind, the body, the breath and the pose.
    89 As you do _AsanaDescriptor , focus on the movements related to going into the pose, the pose itself, and coming out of it. Do them repeatedly in quick succession. Study the efficacy of such dynamics on bodily release and effectiveness of the pose.
    ! 1 Difficulties, whether skeleto-muscular or in the organic body, when doing or staying in a pose, are often due to stiffness or lack of strength for a certain action. These resistance can often be ridden over by quick movements.
    ! 2 Movement, and its associated momentum, speed and gravity effects, help enable muscular strength and action of joints, which will otherwise be impossible in a static or a slow manner of doing the pose. So this approach is excellent to create bodily readiness.
    ! 3 Focusing on dynamics in addition to just on statics helps build strength and flexibility in muscles, joints and even organic body.
    ! 4 When focusing on dynamics and movements involved in a pose, having the breath also play a part either on one extreme with correspondingly quick associated breath, or on the other extreme by a consistent independent moderate breathing cycle, helps study the range of relationships between bodily movements and breath.
    90 [ As you do _AsanaDescriptor , ] Deploy and focus on _BreathDescriptor . With each successive cycle, marginally _BreathTuning the _BreathTunable of _BreathComponent .  Observe how this helps improve the skill in regulation of breath which is key for asana and pranayama .

    92 [ As you do _AsanaDescriptor , ] Work on establishing Associated Condition wherein body, breath, and mind mutually influence and transform one another; both in the final asana, as well as individual actions and corrections. Identify how the character of each in this associated condition is very much more than in isolation. This is one of the first stages in instating yogic aspects.
    ! 1 Associations have the power to completely transform a person, their character and personality. For example, your association with an inspirational person that you revere, or with the workplace environment, the home environment, a social environment, will make significant changes in you, your thoughts and actions. Hence an understanding of associated conditions is key.
    ! 2 Body, body parts and bodily actions in association with breath and mind, are completely transformed from bodily actions alone. This is generally true for body, breath and mind when in association with the other two components respectively. Cultivating this association is a basic learning in yogic practices.
    ! 3 One of the basic tenets of yogic actions is to have mind, body and breath participate in unison with common purpose, and enhance each other in actions and maintenance. This can be brought about by close attention to associating them with each other in all actions, corrections and maintenance.

    96 From the yoga sutras, one way of looking at asana is as something that helps qualify the seeker for classical pranayama. [ As you do _AsanaDescriptor , ] Do your practice as a step towards getting qualified for pranayama. You may do it with particular focus on  _PranayamaQualificationFocus .
    ! 1 While Pranayama is about prana and not just breath, breath is still at the forefront as the primary medium and access route. Hence one thing to do in asanas is to breathify  the embodiment so to speak, so that breath reaches and transforms each and every, even the minutes areas of the body. Similarly the mind and sense organs are kept in close association of breath thereby having the whole embodiment in a suitable state for pranayamic kriyas.
    ! 2 Pranayama needs great access to breath regions like nose-head, throat, chest, abdomen and pelvis. This ability also requires internal access and control on inner muscles in those regions. Breath work focused on such regions, done during asanas, lay the groundwork for effective pranayama.
    ! 3 Pranayama in its maturity uses fine and rarefied breath. Hence one needs to derive all required energy from this minimal breath. Asana practice can be used to develop this ability to be able to sustain asana positions and actions with fine, undisturbed, minimal breath.
    ! 4 Breath in pranayama needs to be able to negotiate the internal embodiment smoothly without hurdles and obstacles - as though it is going along a super-highway. Asana practice can be used to ready the internal embodiment to permit such smooth breath.

    98 Often, the body and musculature lacks freedom and opening, closes upon itself, and shrinks due to bodily and mind resistance. [ As you do _AsanaDescriptor , ] Locate regions to affect opening and expansion. Try doing so from the inside and by applying _BreathComponent action.
    ! 1 Sometimes, the closing-in and resistance of the body in certain regions is so ingrained that it may go unidentified. One way to approach such identification, is through the dynamics of fast movement and opening in different regions appropriate to the asana. The fast movement helps overcome resistance albeit temporarily, but then tells us where the body musculature is closing-in, resisting or lacks freedom to expand.
    ! 2 Affecting opening via breath from the inside, requires a preparatory kriya involving high breath-awareness, complete exhalation, and a period of suspension after it.  That makes the body-matter in the region more supple and receptive, to then directly work on internally opening by breath-kriya.
    ! 3 Complete evacuation prior to the kriya of opening from within greatly helps the opening. A sign that such opening and expansion is well-achieved, is that not too much physical effort is needed to maintain the opening. This is quite different from attempts to open-out purely by body-muscular effort. Also, the effect of the opening lingers for quite some time even after the kriya is over and the asana is released.

    100 As you do _AsanaDescriptor , Make your breath more and more gentle and rarefied. _GentlerBreathObservation .
    ! 1 In an asana, if you observe, a lot of the energy to stay is derived from breath. Making the breath more and more rarefied, gives insights on the inherent bodily ability and comfort of the pose, and unravels the subtle adjustments that the body makes from its own bodily intelligence.
    ! 2 As the sutra says, shvasa prashvasayoh gati viccheda, which indicates rarefying and minimizing breath force and velocity is a step towards pranayama. Rarefying the breath in the pose will give rise to such effects in the body, breath and mind, and will also lead to insights into the autogenic responses of the embodiment.
    ! 3 Rarefying and minimizing breath leads to an experience of internal stillness with absence of activity and internal sound, so to speak. This automatically has a significant effect on the mind which experiences a similar stillness and silence. Maintaining that state in an asana, allows for many subtle observations and learning.
    ! 4 As you rarefy the breath and make it minimal, you will notice that the senses automatically withdraw from external objects. This creates an environment for inward orientation of senses, and a condition where body, breath, mind and senses seemingly become one unified material.

    102 As you do _AsanaDescriptor , Employ Uddiyana Kriya as a preparation phase and study its influence on your practice.
    ! 1 The magic of Uddiyana kriya is that it instantly puts the skin and muscular body, the organs and physiological body, and the breath, directly in very close and purposeful association. This has a special touch and a lasting effect on the rest of the practice when used as a preparatory phase.
    ! 2 Often, practice begins with the asanic components viz. body, breath, mind, senses etc. in a disconnected and sporadic condition, so that close association and integrated state only emerges if the practice is properly done. Uddiyana kriya, as a preparatory phase is one way to awaken these components and almost jolt them into working together as one; right at the beginning of practice.
    ! 3 Uddiyana kriya needs a certain level of skill, muscular access, understanding of breath, and access to organs. Instating the kriya as a preparatory phase requires the practitioner to be sufficiently qualified and familiar with the process.
    ! 4 Uddiyana kriya is not just one fixed process, but comes in several flavours based on parameters such as the type of breath, the different ways to incorporate Uddiyana kriya in exhalation, inhalation and retention phases, the bodily region of emphasis etc. Each of these different instances of Uddiyana kriya, when used as preparation phase, has its own distinct influence on the rest of the practice.

    104 [ As you do _AsanaDescriptor , ] Do normal breathing. Then deploy a deep exhalation in the _BreathRegion . Then do normal breathing again. Repeat this process. Observe how each deep exhalation improves the calibre of the subsequent normal breathing , and takes its plane of operation more and more inward within the embodiment.
    ! 1 A key aspect of mindful exhalation in a region, is the evacuation of impurities and impediments rajasik and tamasik in nature. This purification transforms the state of the embodiment for subsequent actions.
    ! 2 Deep and mindful exhalation has a calming and steadying effect. This steadiness is not one of focus, but of a diffuse deeper calmness. This quietening leads to inward awareness that helps in getting the subsequent actions to begin at a more elevated level.
    ! 3 Deep and mindful exhalation has many effects such as calming, steadying and purifying. But care needs to be taken to ensure that this effect is not obliterated by an onslaught of subsequent action and inhalation.

    109 Study the brain and senses. [ As you do _AsanaDescriptor , ] Have your _BreathComponent and Awareness focused on _SenseRegion . Observe the effect on the mind as well as the culture of the pose.
    110 Study the role of senses organs. As you do _AsanaDescriptor , Have your _BreathComponent and Awareness focused on _EyeRegion , and then again on _EyeRegion . Compare the subtle difference betwen the two in terms of the effect on the mind as well as the culture of the pose.
    ! 1 Sense organs, and kriyas related to them, have a direct influence on the mind and culture, and the sense of I-ness in the person. In fact, sense organs are said to be visheshas or grosser manifestations of the subtle avishesha element of ahamkara (the principle of I-ness, the self-awareness principle).
    ! 2 The sense organs are located primarily in the head region, and close together. And yet, kriyas on each sense organ, and in fact, even different parts of a given sense organ can have a very different influence. For example, the influence of kriyas related to the front of the eyes is almost totally opposite of the influence of kriyas on the back of the eyes.
    ! 3 Focusing breath and awareness on sense organs requires a specific kind of breath which needs to be understood. At the basic level the breath needs to be rarefied with focus and awareness completely devoted on the part of the sense organ in question.
    ! 4 Even in daily life, unknowingly one performs kriyas related to sense organs to bring about a certain mind state and culture. For example, when thinking hard on a mathematical problem, often you'll find that the eyes are narrowed and closed. Learning this subject as part of yoga practice, leads to wonderful insights into the subtleties and possibilities.

    122 Prepare by establising close association of breath and awareness throughout the body. Then [ as you do _AsanaDescriptor , ] instead of working on correcting and improving the Body, work on refining and improving the Body-matter. [ Identify the effect of this endeavour on the mind and mind-matter. ]
    ! 1 We normally focus only on the body, but the yogasana kriyas have the power to transform the very matter and fabric that makes up the body. The association of the asanic components - body, mind, breath, senses and awareness, can bring about such a transformation, that can take one higher along the yogic plane.
    ! 2 Refining of body-matter involves bringing about the sattvik quality of awareness, sensitivity and purity, while cleaning away the tamasik and rajasik impurities of dullness, pride, hyper-activity, etc. This is enabled through breath-body-mind association, heightened awareness in subtle actions, and appropriate breath - either subtle or forceful as suitable for the region and state. Such refining of the body-matter gives rise to an elevated state in the yoga practice.
    ! 3 The refining of body-matter through the association of body-breath-mind, and inculcation of sattvik qualities of awareness and purity, has an effect that lingers beyond just that practice session. The very embodiment substance undergoes a transformation that is quite discernible even for someone who may not be very advanced in their practice. This transformational effect needs to be identified and studied so that it can be sustained in day-to-day life and across practice sessions, and help the practitioner to evolve over time.

    124 [ As you do _AsanaDescriptor , ] Work on improving the connectivity, in terms of body, breath and awareness, between _ConnectivityAreas .
    125 As you do _AsanaDescriptor , Work on improving the connectivity, in terms of body, breath and awareness, between _ConnectivityAreas .
    126 [ As you do _AsanaDescriptor , ] Study what is the natural breathing for the pose when you do not explicitly condition it. Observe atleast the duration, volume, and region.
    ! 1 Just as everybody knows the body position of each asana, one should know that each asana has its own natural breath profile. Identifying that breath profile, is an essential part of understanding the asana.
    ! 2 Just as there is a range of bodily actions applicable to an asana, there is also a range of possible breath actions. And yet, there is a natural breath fingerprint that comes in an asana when no specific action is instated. Learning this breath profile for each asana expands one's repertoire of asanic knowledge and also helps find a whole new set of linkages between asanas.
    ! 3 Often, the choice of asanas to do, is made based on physical condition of the practitioner, the desired state, and the body position of the asana to help getting there. Similarly, there is a whole different plane - that of breath, that can characterise asanas and be a factor in choice of asanas for a desired body or mind effect. Knowing the natural breath profile of an asana is a first step in developing this ability.
    ! 4 The natural breath of an asana is a part of the identity of the asana for a given practitioner. This natural breath needs to be closely understood. Describing the breath in concrete terms like region, duration and volume, is the first basic description before one learns to identify the subtler aspects.
    127 Intensity in doing an asana is both the intensity of the external form (rupaatishayataa) and the internal quality and state (vrittyaatishayataa). As you do _AsanaDescriptor , focus your breath and awareness on _BreathRegion , and  work on the intensity and correctness of the external form, as well as the improvement of the internal breath and mind state in terms of greater awareness, steadiness, quietude etc.
    ! 1 Until a certain level of proficiency is attained, focus on improving the external form of an asana leads to worsening the internal state away from the yogic neutral direction, and vice versa. Therefore in order to improve both the external form and internal state at that level of proficiency, one needs to be mindful of both these aspects and alternate the two by accompanying any action done for one, with a correspondong action for improving the other. Similarly when staying or maintaining.
    ! 2 Once a certain level of proficiency is attained, improving any one between external form or internal state, invariable requires an improvement in the other. At this level, the two necessarily go hand in hand, because the embodiment becomes a unified whole with the breath, mind, internal and external body working together as one to improve and intensify the asana and practice.
    ! 3 Breath is a very effective way to bring awareness on the inner embodiment - inner body, mind and breath. At the same time, it is also effective in amplifying and coordinating external skeleto-muscular actions. This makes breath awareness a very suitable fulcrum point for improving both external form and internal state.
    ! 4 Intensity in internal state is to be understood as increasing its orientation in the yogic direction. Hence it is towards steadiness, neutrality etc. and not intensity as it is normally understood - high application of strength and will.
    ! 5 When learning to improve the xternal form and internal state together, the use of breath awareness as a medium to connect the two is a very effective mode. Moreover, breath and awareness confinement to a given region, helps study it with a clear achievable focus, while still getting embodiment-wide effects due to the inherent connectivity of the rest of the body to that region.

    131 As you do _AsanaDescriptor , ensure that you keep the face completely calm and impassive even as you work on greater intensity [ with focus on _BodyPartsOnly ] . Observe the mind awareness, body dynamics, and breath co-ordination required for the same.
    ! 1 The face is a reflection of the mind. However, it can work the other way too. Hence doing kriyas with an awareness of keeping the face calm and impassive, is a useful way to mitigate the activity and agitation of the mind in an asana.
    ! 2 Even little fluctuations of the mind can impact the face and expression. Hence keeping the face calm and impassive requires one to bring in delicacy in the body, breath and mind kriyas which is a learning in itself.
    ! 3 Keeping one thing constant - such as the impassive calm face, while other things changing with various actions in body, breath and mind, helps one discover and explore new approaches and variations in kriyas that help achieve that constancy. Hence this approach will not only have a big effect on the mind and disposition, but will also help in one's discovery process of an asana.

    ! 1 Just being aware of different stages ranging from preparation, right up to absorption, brings in a different orientation to the asana session due to the sheer big picture view of an asana that's in mind.
    ! 2 When doing an asana, while in any stage, being aware of what the current stage is, what ideally should be the next stage, what should have been the prior stages, brings in a certain maturity in approach, that also has an impact on how the asana is done.
    ! 3 As such, going to the higher stages of an asana requires a very high degree of proficiency. At the same time, being aware of those, and attempting them to whatever extent possible, can raise one's level of practice.

_Approach = 
    1 "Playground"
    ! 1 Playground approach involves spontaneous creativity, and you are involved in trying out various things just naturally, and coming up with something new and different.
    ! 2 Playground approach gives room for serendipity, and there is a chance of learning something unexpected.
    ! 3 Playground approach has a distinct aspect of enjoyment. This draws one closer to the asana and the subject of yoga.    
    2 "Lab"
    ! 1 A lab is a place where all the equipment is available and in order, and pre-planned experiments are performed in order to make observations. In this approach, a similar mode is used in practice.
    ! 2 In a lab, all equipment is ready and available to perform experiments. The asana practice equivalent to this, is a prepared and sensitive emodiment, in terms of body, mind, senses and breath, and the union. The performing of kriyas etc. can be used for the preparation and in the lab experiments.
    ! 3 Two characteristics of lab experiments are the eye on how much precision there is in terms of the margin of error, and the repeatability of the observations. Practicing using the lab approach involves incorporating these characteristics.
    3 "Observation-only"
    ! 1 In the Observation-only approach you observe the practice, the asana, the body, breath, and even mind, “from the outside” as though it is someone else. This has great potential to give you insights and understanding that you won’t get when intimately involved in the pose yourself.
    ! 2 In the Observation-only approach you do not intervene, correct or act, but just watch. This includes the asana, the body, the mind, the breath etc. This is a state where there is freedom from doing things right, correcting, improving etc. while still building a great amount of understanding.
    ! 3 The Observation-only approach involve looking, learning as though you are someone else witnessing. This builds capabilities towards witnessivity or saakshi-bhava which is an essential aspect of the yogic mind.
    4 "Constant Continuous Corrections"
    5 "Optimal Doing for Long Stay"
    6 "Exercise / Workout, Gym-like"
    ! 1 The exercise / workout or gym-like approach is very focused on action or doing. It is also very bodily-focused though it may encompass many aspects like skeleto-muscular, respiratory, and circulatory aspects.
    ! 2 The exercise / workout approach, while being body-oriented and action-oriented, has a natural activating and refreshing effect on the mind by virtue of the circulation, cardio-effects, respiration etc. and in that sense, is very effective in countering tamasic tendencies of stupor while providing energy.
    ! 3 While being very effective and beneficial, the exercise / workout approach misses out on finer actions and deeper learning. For these, one needs to bring in a culture different from the workout culture.
    ! 4 The exercise / workout culture is effective as a preliminary stage in its providing energy, both physical and mental, and in driving away obstacles such as dullness, stupor and unwillingness. These effects can then be channelised towards worldly, material pursuits or inner, finer pursuits, depending on the underlying culture inculcated in the mind of the practitioner through other approaches to practice and learning.
    ! 5 The exercise / workout culture is very effective in bringing about immediate benefits of energy and driving away dullness and resistance. At the same time, one may observe that its effects are relatively short-lived compared to deeper approaches to practice and learning, and should be reinstated through repetition.
    7 "Internal Commentary"
    ! 1 Being able to articulate what one is learning or has learnt, is not only a very effective aid to learning, but also a proof-point to it. Especially for a very subjective field like yoga, this is even more true. The Internal Commentary approach, develops one in that direction.
    ! 2 Commentating is not just describing everything as-is. One has to bring out notable things and highlights, with emphasis on the important things. In addition, there is an element of providing background, contexts, and insights. Practising with an Internal Commentary approach helps hones one's understanding because one has to really have a deep grasp to be able to do this well.
    ! 3 Different commentators often have very different commentaries for the same event. There is a personality aspect to commentary - a commentary may be serious, it may be easily-excitable, it may be insightful, it may be detailed and descriptive etc. As one develops the skill for an Internal Commentary, one can adopt different personalities to colour the Internal Commentary and develop the skill to a new level.    
    8 "Take an Internal Snapshot, and then Apply all Required Corrections in one Integrated Phase"
    9 "Modelling for a Photograph"
    ! 1 When doing an asana with the mindset of modelling for a photograph, there is high physicality and very little inward thinking. Yet, there is a significant focus on aesthetic detail and things like striking the right physical alignment.
    ! 2 While the mindset of modelling for a photograph is not very conducive for philosophical growth, it has its own benefits in terms of bodily toning. The other significant learning that it helps inculcate is being able to stay in an asana at length and yet as it were, with a smile.
    ! 3 When doing an asana with a mindset of modelling for a photograph it is very instructive to imagine the photographer being in different positions - in the front, in the back, on the left side, on the right side, high, low etc. With the photographer in these positions, different body regions come into focus and require toning and corrections, even while potentially allowing other hidden regions to slacken. This helps understand the asana better and in a very different way.    
    10 "Study Room Mindset"
    ! 1 The study room mindset is about contemplation, deeper understanding and internalising. That should be the focus.
    ! 2 In the study room mindset, one may ask oneself different questions of the thing being studied, and tried them out solidify one’s understanding.
    ! 3 The study room mindset is not about learning new things, but about getting a more solid understanding of what has been recently learnt and fitting that into the overall body of one’s knowledge.    
    11 "Teacher's"
    ! 1 Teacher’s approach involves trying to present and articulate specific aspects and lessons.
    ! 2 Teacher’s approach involves more outwardness - imparting than receiving.
    ! 3 Teacher’s approach has a certain degree of certainty of knowledge, and less doubt, questioning and exploring.

    2 _AsanaSet
    ! 1 NO HINTS
    
_SingleAsana = 
    1 Shirshasana
    ! 1 From a skeleto-muscular perspective, shirshasana helps develop steadiness, and awareness in all body musculature due to the need for balance and the inherent need to reduce the gravitational weight on the head.
    ! 2 Shirshasana, due to its inverted position, gives a new configuration for the organic body. This lends itself to specific study with the focus on the organic body via body and breath interactions.
    ! 3 Shirshasana's position, the blood circulation in the head, and the need to maintain balance, leads to significant involvement of the sense organs - eyes, ears, nose. So the pose lends itself to study of these sense organs by trying out different breath interactions, or their effect on the mind.
    ! 4 Shirshasana leads to and requires steadiness in the mind. It can be used to generate a whole range from calming effects to energising effects. This lends itself to study of mind states as it evolves with staying in the pose, and how it is affected by body and breath state.
    ! 5 The breath in Shirshasana is in the inverted direction due to the inverted pose. At the same time it is straight without constrictions. This makes the asana very suitable for breath studies by observing breath either in different regions or with different parameters like duration and volume.
    ! 6 Shirshasana due to its position and the involvement of the head-face is particularly suitable to study breath effects in the head and brain region. The breath effects can range from the very rajasic to calming, neutral and sattvik depending on how breath is deployed and how the pose is struck.
    2 Sarvangasana
    ! 1 In Sarvangasana, most of the body parts are in a special role and position, different from many other asanas.
    ! 2 Sarvangasana has a natural bent towards neutral, tranquil and sattvik mindset.
    ! 3 While the breath in Sarvangasana is a bit constrained, it is in very close contact with organs allowing opportunities to learn the interactions.
    ! 4 Sarvangasana is very suitable to study the senses, and the eye, ear, nose, throat, brain areas.
    ! 5 Since Sarvangasana has a distinct bent towards calming and sattvik mindset, it also allows for clear observations of effect of various approaches and actions on the mind.
    3 Padmasana
    ! 1 Padmasana, one of the iconic poses, has a certain symmetry and compactness to it. It naturally pushes one towards the right erect posture - spine erect, shoulder-blades in, chest up etc. In fact, it is rather difficult to maintain a slouch or a wrong posture in it for a long time.
    ! 2 The breath profile in padmasana is naturally straight, with good access to the trunk and organs, as well as the head-brain-face areas. The diaphragm and the pelvic floor are also naturally parallel to the ground leading to a well, auto-generated, integrated profile.
    ! 3 In padmasana, breath and mind awareness naturally tends towards the back-brain and back-spine.  This draws the mind towards a reflective and meditative orientation conducive to yogic studies. 
    ! 4 In padmasana, a key aspect is the how the heels are positioned and touch the trunk. This automatically sets right the position, naturally triggering an erect posture, a breath with full access, and mind sharp yet reflective as it tends to backwards to the root of the brain.
    4 Supta Baddha Konasana
    ! 1 Supta Baddha Konasana is a very suitable pose for working on and studying the organs. The abdomen and pelvic region gets space both latitudinally and longitudinally.
    ! 2 Supta Baddha Konasana is very suitable for acting with, acting on, and studying the breath. This includes various graphic modes.
    ! 3 Supta Baddha Konasana allows access to various bodily regions and systems, and hence is suitable for various kinds of studies.
    ! 4 Supta Baddha Konasana can be used to study mind-effects. Both using mind as an instrument as well as creating effects on the mind via other body components and breath.    
    5 Supta Virasana
    ! 1 Supta virasana is a supine pose and yet with a significant and useful physical, skeleto-muscular component to it. This activity of muscles - right from thigh muscles, back muscles to chest muscles in a supine pose is very effective since it lends itself to a prolonged stay.
    ! 2 Supta virasana is a special as a supine pose in how it provides continuity in the embodiment's position from the top of the trunk through the hip area down the tighs without any of the usual diversion in flow near the hip area. This allows for effective studies of breath and awareness.
    ! 3 Supta virasana has strong bodily awareness, and yet is a supine pose allowing for breath, sense and mind awareness. It is also special in how it  provides an avenue for expansion both longitudinally and latitudinally, which allows for pronounced organ and breath effects.
    ! 4 Supta virasana allows for a wide range of mind effects due to its very position, balanced involvement of skeleto-muscular and organic body, as well as breath and mind. For example, it is very effective as a preparatory pose at the beginning of a session as well as a final pose towards the end of the session, and can bring about associated mind effects for both these somewhat opposite states.
    ! 5 Supta virasana allows for limb focus, trunk and back focus, very effective organs focus as well as breath-focus that can span the entire trunk deep into the pelvic area as well. It is also suited for study of graphical breath especially since the pose does not break the continuity of the trunk right down through the pelvis and hips. If you take into account the range of mind effects it can be used to generate, this pose is very effective for many purposes right from physical preparation to subtle awareness studies.    
    6 Setubandha Sarvangasana
    ! 1 Setubandha sarvangasana is a sarvangasana variation while also being a backbend pose. One special thing from a backbend pose perspective is how it allows you direct surgical access to different regions of the back by use of the hands. You can perform back studies by breath, by internal observations, but also by using the hands to feel areas from shoulder blades to lower back if necessary.
    ! 2 Setubandha sarvangasana has special effects on the mind. From being a back bend pose, it has a natural energizing  effect, whereas from being sarvangasana variation, and with its chinlock, it has a natural inward calming effect on the mind.
    ! 3 Setubandha sarvangasana allows very specific work on abdominal organs by means of a combination of the use of hands from outside and breath from within. Slight modification in the hand position, and the wide range of breath deployment, can give deep insights. In addition, the chinlock has a natural profound effect on the breath profile.
    ! 4 Setubandha sarvangasana has a effect of opening the hip region, extending the groin region and flattening the abdominal region which allows body studies involving both skeleto-muscular as well as organic aspects. At the same time the chinlock has a great influence on breath which further helps in evacuating the abodminal region instating uddiyana kriya.
    ! 5 Setubandha sarvangasana is special in being among the few backbend poses that allow a longer stay thereby allowing deeper, slower and sustained studies and effects. By virtue of also being a sarvangasana variation, there is a natural inward breath profile as well as an inward mind direction.
    7 Vipareeta Karani
    8 Janu Shirshasana
    ! 1 Janu Shirshasana is a very suitable pose as an initial forward bend pose.
    ! 2 Janu Shirashasana also involves an aspect of extension, twisting and expansion, and not just the forward bend action.
    ! 3 Janu Shirshasana is suitable for longer stay, and has sufficient freedom of breath for greater studies.
    ! 4 Janu Shirshasana has a distinct skeleto-muscular component to its doing, and also allows access to the organs.
    ! 5 Janu Shirshasana has clearly evident effects on the mind, with a inherent leaning towards sattvikness and neutrality.
    9 Bharadwajasana
    ! 1 Bharadwajasana is an excellent asana as a gateway into twisting poses. Yet it is distinctive in that while there is twisting, there is also an open chest and much more freedom of breath than most other twisting poses.
    ! 2 Bharadwajasana has more degrees of freedom than other twisting poses. This allows experimenting on what areas of the torso involve movement to engender twisting, and which areas should in fact resist that movement for effective pose.
    ! 3 Bharadwajasana allows significant freedom in breath. This allows one to study breath effects in various ways. This is more so than other twisting poses where breathing is more constrained and difficult.
    ! 4 Bharadwajasana is one of those asanas that easily lend themselves for generation of various mind states ranging from relaxation to rejuvanation, and including inwardly reflection. This is further enhanced by the freedom and efficacy of breath inherent in the pose.
    ! 5 In Bharadwajasana, the skeleto-muscular and organic system involvement is quite significant, yet it is special in this asana that, it is easy for these body systems to strike the necessary configuration and then take a back seat to allow breath and mind studies to take over.
    10 Mareechasana
    11 Urdhvadhanurasana
    ! 1 Urdhvadhanurasana is interesting for the number of ways to go into the pose and come out of it. You can raise yourself from the floor and go back down, or drop down from an upright position and come back up, or drop back from full arm balance and come back through vipareeta chakrasana. And you can also mix and match a way of going into the pose and a way of coming out of it.
    ! 2 Urdhvadhanurasana is among the best poses to allow you to explore back bends in relation to center of gravity. You can lean forward on the hands opening the upper trunk and pushing with the legs, or shift the weight more towards the hips and legs. You can also swing back and forth between these. Each of this gives key insights to understand backbend poses.
    ! 3 Urdhvadhanurasana has this aspect of not only going forwards and backwards between the hand-side and the feet-side, but importantly also going higher up and walking in. This is a great range of possible movements while still in the pose allowing you to learn more with each.
    ! 4 Urdhvadhanurasana is not easy for breath related study because it is hard to stay long and hard on breathing as well. At the same time, there is range of breathing that can be explored in this pose once one is sufficiently prepared. This helps improve skills of breath deployment, but also helps in studying the effect that breath can have on improving the body’s ability in the pose.
    ! 5 Urdhvadhanurasana is a quintessential backbend pose, and each body part has a specific and important configuration. This lends itself to study breath in various regions and how it has an effect not only in the region in question, but also smoothly propagates an effect throughout the embodiment. The smooth propagation is assisted by the smooth and continuous configuration and curvature of the pose.    
    12 Vipareetadandasana
    ! 1 Vipareeta dandasana with a chair or support, is very different from doing it without any support. Yet, both are quintessential backbend poses and can provide great insights and learning - from a body perspective, as well as from a breath-action perspective.
    ! 2 In vipareeta dandasana, it is important to focus not only on the chest and the ventral side, but significantly on the back and dorsal side. An even focus and awareness in both takes you to the real asana.
    ! 3 Vipareeta dandasana allows progressive learning of back bends as you do it with and without support, and gaining bodily composure, organic body effects, and breath kriyas.
    ! 4 While in general, it is not easy to stay for longer periods in backbend poses, vipareeta dandasana lends itself greatly for longer stays and deeper studies. This should be done both with and without support as per the proficiency of the practitioner.
    ! 5 Vipareeta dandasana is a very suitable backbend pose for studying breath kriyas on the organic body; whether from the chest region, the abdominal region, or the pelvic region.    
    13  Paschimottanasana
    ! 1 Paschimottanasana is a quintessential forward bend pose, so all aspects need to get rightly oriented accordingly to strike it.
    ! 2 Paschimottanasana being a quintessential forward bend pose, is a good pose to work on preliminaries and orientation through many other preparatory poses.
    ! 3 Paschimottanasana is not an easy asana, and a good pose to study how breath and body can work together to strike higher degrees.
    ! 4 Paschimottanasana, once attained to equilibrium, is a good pose for effects on the mind. Can be used to fully relax the mind at one end, or energize a tired mind at the other end.
    14 Trikonasana
    ! 1 Trikonsasana works very well as an index pose for the standing poses category. From a skeleto-muscular perspective it has the benefits of stability, extensions, involvement of the entire body, and opening up of the various regions.
    ! 2 Trikonasana allows clear access to lungs and abdominal organs. There is also expansion and aeration of the organs. Thus it lends itself to basic studies of the organs, actions related to them, their interactions with breath, and effects on the mind.
    ! 3 Trikonasana allows a clear and wide pathway for breath and hence is quite suitable for breath studies. The branching of breath, to reach the limbs, as well as the various graphic modes or shapes of breath can be studied. Add to that the fact that the skeleto-muscular and organic systems are also activated, and this pose lends itself well to detailed analytical studies of each aspect by itself, and their interactions.
    ! 4 Trikonasana has a natural energizing effect on the mind. This comes about due to the configuration of the skeleto-muscular body, the opening of the chest and the expansion of the abdominal and pelvic organs, as well as the possibility to inundate the body with breath. All this makes this a good pose to study the broader mind effects since they are clearly discernible.    
    15 Parivritta Trikonasana
    ! 1 Parivritta Trikonasana is a great combination of a basic standing posture with a intense twisting element to it.
    ! 2 Parivritta Trikonasana allows the freedom of breath characteristic of standing poses while at the same time adding the exalted effect on the organic system due to the twisting.
    ! 3 Parivritta Trikonasana has a strong skeleto-muscular emphasis, a strong involvement of the senses to maintain balance and steadiness, and also a strong involvement of the organic system and breath.
    ! 4 Parivritta Trikonasana due to its delicate balance is useful to study the impact of weight and gravity distribution, and the role of the points that touch the ground.    
    16 Ardhachandrasana
    ! 1 The difficulty and the need for balance in Ardhachandrasana makes it a difficult pose for deeper and sustained studies, since the attention is repeatedly drawn to the physicality of the pose.
    ! 2 Ardhachandrasana inherently needs attention and awareness to be present throughout the body just to be able to stay in the pose. Hence it is a good pose to take advantage of this, and work on channelising this attention rather than having it move sporadically.
    ! 3 It is not easy to maintain position in Ardhachandrasana. That makes it a useful pose to study the maintenance of position by breath and internal activities rather than from peripheral skeleto-muscular effort alone.
    17 Jathara Partivartanasana
    ! 1 Jathara Parivartanasana is interesting for skeleto-muscular study since the various body parts are pulling or being pulled in a certain distinct direction.
    ! 2 Jathara Parivartanasana is very suitable for study of the organic system due to the asanas direct exalted action on the organs.
    ! 3 Jathara Parivartanasana is interesting from its mind-state effects due to effects ranging from calming to refreshing both due to direct acts on the mind and breath, plus the great influence on the mind from its action on the abdominal and pelvic organs.
    ! 4 Jathara Parivartanasana allows one to have intense action, and yet relax and refresh, making it very suitable for various experiments and studies.
    18 Prasarita Padottanasana
    ! 1 Prasarita paddotanasana is a good mix in terms of being an overlap between what we often call standing poses and forward bends. It has key characteristics of both, and as is readily evident, has the skeleto-muscular finesse of the former and the bent towards a calm neutral mind state of the latter.
    ! 2 Prasarita padottanasana is interesting in how it lends itself quite completely to a forward and extended back, as well as to a completely concave back. This allows one to study the spine, abdomen and chest region, as well as a variety of breath deployments in each case.
    ! 3 From an organic body point of view, prasarita padottanasana is special in how it can have the organs in a stretched, almost horizontal position, with perpendicular gravitational effects in the concave back positions, as well as in a rested position along the gravity-line when the head is touching down. Deeper insights into the same can be gained by breath association.
    ! 4 Prasarita padottanasana is a good asana in which to study the variation in mind effects since it has a range of positions from a concave back and head up position, to a forward extended back with head rested. Each has a distinct effect on the mind and that is worthy of study and noting.
        
_AsanaSet =
    1 Standing Poses
    ! 1 Standing poses are a great starting point for practice. They have great degree of focus on skeleto-muscular aspects, and yet allow working on the organ system, have freedom for breath studies, as well as discernible effects on the mind.
    ! 2 Working through Standing Poses  prepares you practice of various other asanas.
    ! 3 Standing poses are great for studying inter-connectedness of the embodiment by seeing how movement in certain area affects all others.
    ! 4 Standing Poses have a particular focus on gravity/weight distribution through the body, as well as on balance.
    2 Back Bends
    ! 1 Backbends are not an easy set of poses for breath-related studies since breath is often short in those poses. Hence this needs a different type of skill and involvement, and helps one learn how to get over such difficulties.
    ! 2 Though prolonged stay and hence breath and mind studies are not so easy in backbends, there is a great awareness and involvement of the spine, which generates great effects on the mind.
    ! 3 The various backbend poses are very different from each other in action and effects, and so each pose is quite a separate asana for learning, observation and experimentation.
    3 Shirshasana Variations
    ! 1 Shirshasana variations is a great set of asanas whether the focus is on the body, breath or the mind.
    ! 2 For the grosser body aspects like the skeleto-muscular body including the limbs, the Shirshasana variations pose a challenge for strength, access, as well as flexibility. They also help tone the skeleto-muscular aspects and make them firm and bonified.
    ! 3 For the organic body Shirshasana variations have a very natural association. The abdominal organs, the pelvic organs, as well as the brain, has a key role to play in the poses, and the exalted effect on them can be studied.
    ! 4 Shirshasana variations are also conducive for mind focus. This includes the “muscle of the mind” aspects due to the need to maintain balance and strength through the poses and the time of stay, as well as the subtler mind effects due to the very nature of the inversion, the blood circulation, as well as the anti-gravity position.
    ! 5 Shirshasana variations are a great set of poses to study the reach of breath. This includes breath shapes, various breath parameters like region, volume, etc.
    ! 6 Shirshasana variations can be used to study breath effects even for subtler aspects of breath and mind. This may be done to keep the breathing cycle mild and invariant, while still maintain balance and strength, which helps build holistic understanding of the pose. 
    ! 7 Shirshasana variations are quite special in the range of their reach - in terms of body parts, organic system, the skill required, the breath involvement, effects on the mind, and the overall vehicle for improvement and study.
    4 Sarvangasana Variations
    ! 1 Sarvangasana variations have a natural tendency to subdue the mind and not let the mind get overtly rajasik.
    ! 2 Sarvangasana variations naturally involve the entire body in its actions and learnings.
    ! 3 Sarvangasana variations have the abdominal organs etc. in a relaxed state and allow for exalted action and exploration of them.
    ! 4 Sarvangasana variations involve a significant degree of movement allowing a range of action and learning.
    ! 5 Sarvangasana variations let’s one work equally either on skeleto-muscular aspects or the organic aspects.
    ! 6 Sarvangasana variations involve an interesting breath profile. While as such somewhat  constrained and restricted in range, it has quite a direct association with the mind.
    ! 7 Sarvangasana variations involve an interesting breath profile. While as such somewhat  constrained and restricted in range, breathing in different regions have a clearly visible distinct feel and effect.
    5 Forward Bends
    ! 1 Forward bends have a natural bent towards a calm mind. This makes it suitable for studying mind-state, as well as steady breath and body interactions.
    ! 2 Forward bends lend themselves to breath focussed on the back / dorsal side. This makes it quite special since in many other cases the natural tendency is towards the chest, abdomen and generally the frontal side.
    ! 3 Forward bends have an understated yet important interaction between the limb musculature, the spine and the overall pose.
    ! 4 Forward bends allow for back actions involving flattening, widening, and straightening which is not done in most other positions.
    ! 5 Forward bends and their natural propensity towards a calm mind, make it suitable for breath studies in the head-face region as well as in the sense organs (eyes, ears, nose).
    ! 6 The elongated profile of the back in forward bends, along with the natural leaning for breath on the dorsal back, allows for study of breath shapes and modes that are quite distinctive to these poses.
    6 Twisting
    ! 1 Twisting poses are special in that they are almost unique to yoga. The skeleto-muscular actions as well as the action on abdominal organs are quite unique in these poses.
    ! 2 Twisting poses bring in an important mix of assisting the action from one region of the body to resisting the action from another. It is the combination of the two that brings in an effective twisting action from the right area.
    ! 3 Twisting poses require a good understanding of the spinal area as well as the organs. One must make sure that a flexible part does not over-compensate for the other areas leading to what looks like right twisting, but is not.
    ! 4 Breath is quite constrained in twisting poses. This makes these a good set of poses to study how one can work on the body configuration to help the breath flow, as opposed to the usual way of deploying breath for improved bodily effects.
    ! 5 Twisting poses are not easy for breath flow. This brings up a challenge and helps develop the skill of using the breath force to still gain access to the range of the embodiment.
    ! 6 In twisting poses, the skeleto-muscular body and limbs play an understated but an important role. To be able to strike and maintain the pose, skeleto-muscular involvement and skill is key, though the asanas eventually shift natural focus to the organic system.    
    7 Padangushthasana Poses
    ! 1 Padangushthasana poses are a blessing to the limb region. And the limbs if firm, have a great effect on the mind-state.
    ! 2 Padangushthasana poses have a far reaching access from limbs to back, to pelvic musculature and spine. Often they can help prepare the body for greater efficacy for various categories of poses from forward bends to back bends to twisting.
    ! 3 Padangushthasana poses have a good balance of allowing action and exploration, and yet not being too difficult or tiring. So they are good for study.
    ! 4 Padangushthasana poses allow minute observation of joints, muscles, skin-flesh interaction, as well as the reach of breath in various parts of the body.
    ! 5 Padangushthasana poses also allow one to work on the mind-state by allowing a composite work from skeleto-muscular body to organs to breath, and allowing one to stay in the pose long enough.
    ! 6 Padangushthasana poses have a way of generating positive effects on the breath and mind all by their own, without too much of conscious effort.

_AsanaPhase = 
    1 Preparation Phase
    ! 1 Preparation phase may be just before doing an asana, or may go way back with a big run up through several other asanas.
    ! 2 Preparation phase involves extensive thinking and learning from experience and is not just doing.
    ! 3 Preparation phase depends not only on the asana that you are preparing for, but also why you will be doing the asana, what is the purpose in mind (learning, release, etc).
    ! 4 Preparation phase varies from person to person, body and mind conditions, the purpose of preparation, and is not a standardized thing.    
    2 Going-into-the-Pose Phase
    ! 1 The phase of going into the pose is very interesting in that it sets the tone for the pose. Also for some asanas, there are various ways to go into the pose. For example, multiple ways of going into urdhvadhanurasana are well-known: you can rise from the floor, drop back from an upright back-arch, or fall back from full arm balance. Even for asanas like parivritta trikonasana, there are alternatives. You can jump and spread your feet apart and go directly into parivritta trikonasana, or can come into a parshvottasana like stage with both hands on the ground and then raise one up to parivritta trikonasana. Thinking through these things help us learn more.
    ! 2 The efficacy of the pose often depends on how you go into the pose. For example, sometimes you may first set one body part in its final position - like the straightening and locking the lower leg when doing supta padangushthasana, and then do the subsequent action, like raising the other leg in this case. On the other hand, you may leave all parts of the body loose and free first and get into the pose - in this case one leg down, another raised, but both loose and not yet straight; and then get them into the final position. The effects of these can be radically different.
    ! 3 The variation in going into a pose is not only in terms of bodily actions. Breath can play a major part in it. For example, at a broad level you may go with inhalation, with exhalation, or even with an established and undisturbed breath cycle. Each can bring a different effect both on the pose itself as well as its effectiveness and even the mind state.
    ! 4 While going into the pose, even when focusing only on variations in bodily action, the possibilities are quite evident. As a simple example, for many poses, you can go with a rapid dynamic and complete action, can go with a gradual controlled actions, or can go with setting right body parts one by one. Each of these has a different effect and can further vary by the asana under consideration.    
    3 Coming-out-of-the-Pose Phase
    ! 1 The process of coming out of a pose starts while one is still in the pose and begins the thought process of coming out of it. Identify the effects that have to be retained and those that are to be withdrawn.
    ! 2 The process of coming out of a pose also depends on what asana is to be done next. The mind, body and breath should be oriented towards the next asana while retaining the important influences of the current one.
    ! 3 There is a range of ways to come out a pose. In some cases, sharp quick movements are appropriate and in other cases slow careful deliberate movements are. It is dependent on what is the current pose, the next pose, and the purpose of the practice.
    ! 4 It is instructive to learn body and breath movements that will form a continuity when coming out of one pose and going into the next, rather than a break in between.
    
    
_AsanaComponent =
    1 Body
    ! 1 Focus on Body is not easy since the body is not a single localized thing. A proficient practioner may be able to take stock of the body as a whole, but others need to develop some scheme of their own - for example, scan from feet to head etc.
    ! 2 Body focus implies much greater focus on body than on other components like the breath and mind. It includes both the skeleto-muscular aspects as well as the organic system.
    ! 3 One way of Body focus would be to look at inter-connectedness among different areas, and how slight movements/adjustments in one impacts others.
    2 Mind
    ! 1 Mind is one of the key components of an asana. Just like we make actions using the body, and look at effects on the body, similarly, the same is applicable to the mind, and perhaps even more so.
    ! 2 There are various ways to characterise mind. One way is to use terms related to emotional states - angry, tired, happy, enthusiastic, confused etc. The other is from the perspective of intelligence and rational aspects - mature, sage-like, child-like, logical/illogical, strong etc. The other is to use broad categories of sattva, raja, tama, and then use finer aspects within each to categorise the state of mind.
    ! 3 Mind has a volitional / will-power aspect, a receiving / sensitive aspect, an observational / experiencing aspect, and a thinking analytical aspect, as well as a creative aspect. Each of these aspects are directly applicable to asana practice, and observing this closely can develop key insights and wisdom.
    ! 4 Mind states directly influence breath, and can also get influenced by it. Similarly mind directly influences the body and gets influenced by it. The details of these interactions and influences in the various asanas are very worth of study.
    ! 5 Mind is well-known as something hard to control. Bhagavad Gita makes explicit mention of this. Study of asanas can help one learn how to overcome this. Oftentimes such control or regulation may be made possible by effective use of breath and body, rather than by the mind itself.
    3 Breath
    ! 1 Breath can be seen as the center of neutrality. Body may have lethargy, ego, self-centeredness, mind may have such characteristics, but breath is essentially neutral.
    ! 2 Body and mind belong to the embodiment, but breath is external to it. It can be viewed as the cosmic energy gracing the embodiment with its arrival and departure.
    ! 3 Breath is also a magical toolbox. It can be deployed for things ranging from a divine blessing with feather touch, to the strength like an excavator or earth-mover.
    ! 4 The association of breath with body parts, with actions or with mind states, brings about an essential transformation and effect, that can be very clearly subjectively observed.
    ! 5 There is a very wide, almost infinite set of ways in which breath may be deployed or breathing may happen. The key parameters are region, duration, and volume. However, beyond that there is also the association with sound forms, as well as graphic modes of breath by incorporating various breath-shapes like cylindrical and conical.
    ! 6 Asanas can be done in a condition where the embodiment is steeped in breath as though it has been kneaded into the very material. The experience of asanas in this mode gives a glimpse of neutrality that is so essential to yoga.

_Sense = 
    1 Eye-sense
    ! 1 The eye-sense has a very close relation with the mind. For example, becoming aware of the corner of the eye that's near the nose, immediately focuses the mind. Similarly, focusing on the lower edge of the eye makes the mind pensive, focus on the upper region makes the mind extroverted. The study of this in asanas is fascinating.
    ! 2 One mode of working on the eye-sense is by breath in that region. Fine soft breath directed in different directions in different parts, corners and surfaces of the eyes have a remarkably different and discernible effect.
    ! 3 One aspect of eye-awareness is the movement, or lack of it, of the eye balls. Another aspect is, when the eyes are steady, where are they centered - left, right, upward, downward, and even outside or inward drawn. These aspects have a significant impact on the asana as can be seen with various types of asanas like shirshasana and shavasana, and even ardhachandrasana and veerabhadrasana III.
    2 Ear/Hearing-sense
    ! 1 The hearing sense is special in being sensitive to subtle sounds and vibrations. This enables someone, who may even be a beginner, to become sensitive to the inner activity and vibration of asanas - particularly of breath, just by bringing awareness to the hearing sense.
    ! 2 The hearing sense does not refer just to external sounds but also to the sensitivity to subtle vibrations and sounds, as well as to the overall balance. Becoming aware of the hearing sense can therefore enable one to become acquainted with the subtle aspects of an asana.
    ! 3 The hearing sense is very amenable to be drawn inwards, and is a great enabler of inner awareness. It is among the most effective of the senses, for someone in a beginning stage to turn inwards, and lead to a state that is very aware of the inside and insulated from the outside; while still not compromising on the physical intensity and correctness of the posture.
    ! 4 The hearing sense is very suitable to be allied to breath and its patterns. The combination of the two can then provide a means of exploration into the asana.
    3 Touch-sense
    ! 1 The touch-sense is one that is often overlooked. It is one with the greatest breadth over the embodiment, and the greatest variation over that.
    ! 2 In normal practices, touch-sense is usually referred to as touch things external to the embodiment, but yogic studies also involve turning that inwards.
    ! 3 In yogasanas, you when doing somewhat subtler actions, you extend the skin, rotate the skin, tighten or loosen. When doing this, there are insights to be gained if you focus on how the skin in that part interacts with the underlying flesh.
    ! 4 Breath is a key means to study the inward-turning of the touch-sense.
    ! 5 Yogasanas allow a huge degree of breath activity involving, inhalation, exhalation, retention, breath in various duration, volume, regions, breath in graphic modes, and with sound-forms. In all of these, there is a touch sensation that is discernible as the breath interacts with the internal aspects. This touch sensation can be focused upon and studied.

_BodyAspect = 
    1 _BodySystem
    ! 1 NO HINTS
    2 _BodyPart
    ! 1 A precaution to take when focusing on a specific body part when performing an asana, especially for people with flexible bodies, is to avoid exaggerated action in that body part. Instead aim to achieve a balance of awareness, in particular, on all sides, directions and angles in relation to that body part.
    ! 2 Focusing on a body part is a basic initial step towards learning how to channel one's awareness in an asana. It helps one learn how almost automatically one can unify bodily, mind and breath awareness in an asana.
    ! 3 Focusing on a body part helps one learn about that body part in different asanas. It also helps one learn about the influence of the body part on the rest of the embodiment and vice versa.
    
_BodySystem =
    1 Skeleto-muscular Body
    ! 1 The skeleto-muscular body is the one we are most directly familiar with and have access to. Hence it is a good place to start learning the various lessons of Yoga.
    ! 2 The skeleto-muscular body comes in a variety of structural and functional types from limbs, bones, muscles, spine, and various types of joints. Each has its own unique contribution that can be an enriching study.
    ! 3 Different areas of the skeleto-muscular body can also be thought about using terms analogous to that for mind-states. So an area may be soft, hard, flexible, right, puffed, mild etc. This has a direct bearing on the mind-state as well.
    ! 4 The skeleto-muscular body is at the most gross-level compared to other components like the organic body, breath, mind, senses etc. The disadvantage is that focus on that alone, does not help engender subtler effects. However the big advantage is that for someone still learning, the actions and effects produced here are quite pronounced and easily evident. For example, the effect of breath on movement is readily discernible.    
    2 Organic Body
    ! 1 The organic body has a great effect on the mind state. The organic body can make have the effect of bringing about happiness, positivity, to irritability, dullness or sorrow. Hence actions involving the organic body have long ranging effects.
    ! 2 Actions involving the organic body can be things akin to skeleto-muscular acts like stretching, lengthening, flattening, hardening, twisting, turning etc. At the other end it can be things involving the breath like forceful and strong breath acts, gentle caressing by breath, deep seepage by breath, and even kriyas like uddiyana kriyas.
    ! 3 Organic actions can be done with an eye on activating the organs or relaxing them. Similarly one can have acts by breath for nourishing the organic body region or on the other hand evacuating the region. These are all acts involving the organic body but have totally different effects, not only on the body, but also on mind.
    ! 4 Just like every asana has a physical or a skeleto-muscular signature defining its position, and the details of stretching, turning, in the various parts of the body; every asana also has a organic body signature related to the configurations of the organic system peculiar to the asana. This is a good area of study to develop greater insights not only about the organic body but also on the asanas in question.    

_BodyPart =
    1 Body
    ! 1 Focus on Body is not easy since the body is not a single localized thing. A proficient practioner may be able to take stock of the body as a whole, but others need to develop some scheme of their own - for example, scan from feet to head etc.
    ! 2 Body focus implies much greater focus on body than on other components like the breath and mind. It includes both the skeleto-muscular aspects as well as the organic system.
    ! 3 One way of Body focus would be to look at inter-connectedness among different areas, and how slight movements/adjustments in one impacts others.    
    2 Shoulders
    ! 1 The shoulder area is often an overlooked area in a pose. It may perhaps be because it neighbours key areas like the hands and the chest.
    ! 2 The shoulder area renders sturdiness to a pose, but at the same time also is a region for stiffness. Understanding the shoulder can help tackle stiffness.
    ! 3 Access by breath to the shoulder area is not straightforward and requires quite some amount of skill. At the same time, access via breath enables penetration into layers of musculature that is not so easy just by physical movements.
    ! 4 The shoulder area, though not evidently a locus of movement, undergoes great movement by influence of arms, neck, shoulder blades and chest, and that itself is worthy of study. Moreover the shoulder area has a distinctive rolling action that is key in many asanas.    
    3 Chest
    4 Shoulder-blades
    ! 1 Shoulder-blades muscles are not easy to reach and set right. There is a substantial influence of the chest region, the lower back, the upper chest, and floating ribs. Yet, focusing on setting the shoulder-blades right, is a good way to attain a good position without having to deal with the details of the so many other connected parts.
    ! 2 The proximity of the shoulder-blades to the diaphragm and abdominal organs, as well as with the lungs makes it a very interesting area for using the skeleto-muscular part to greatly influence the organs.
    ! 3 The shoulder-blade area is different in that it is not quite a joint like all the others, yet has a pre-dominant influence of the bones. Then again the muscles converge, radiate and moves in various directions making it a good area to learn action that is not easily visible, and is non-obvious. Focus on how the muscles are oriented, how the move against the skin and flesh, will help enhance the power of observation of these aspects.
    ! 4 Shoulder-blades are a great area to learn the effect of breath on the embodiment. For most people, it is not an area fo subtle breath actions (at least to begin with), but an area to learn how sharp, solid and deployed breath, whether in inhalation, exhalation or retention, can radically transform both the posture and gesture of the asana.
    ! 5 Breath with focus on should-blade region directly and closely involves both the chest and the abdomen. This makes the shoulder-blades a very good area for study of action by breath, and study of connectivity to adjoining breath-centered areas.
    ! 6 Shoulder-blades hold a direct key to mind state. You can easily change their position to transform the mind state to anything between dull and unwilling, to attentive and sharp. So shoulder-blades are a good area for basic observations of effect of body parts on mind state.

    9 Legs
    ! 1 Legs are usually considered a grosser area of the embodiment with subtler aspects elsewhere. However, there is a variety of subtler aspects in the legs, its skin and how it touches the underlying flesh, the rotation of the leg, whether it is puffed or mild etc.
    ! 2 Legs are hard to reach in terms of direct access via breath. However, subtle and deep breath-with-supplements help one reach even the legs.
    ! 3 If leg muscles are weak, loose, or one does not have good access to it, the asana may be affected to the extent of it seeming lifeless. So the limbs should not be considered unimportant.
    ! 4 Legs can be decomposed into thighs, knees, calves, shin, ankles and feet, with each area being observed separately, and potentially having an orientation in different directions.
    ! 5 There is a significant effect on mind state of leg muscles - depending on whether they are tight, loose, connected to the rest of the embodiment or not.    
    10 Limb-muscles
    ! 1 Though it may not be readily apparent in the beginning, limb muscles have quite a range of internal movements and actions. For example, they may be loosened to allow movements elsewhere, they may be stretched away from the root, they may be stretched towards the root, they may aid in extension of the limbs, or they may be pulled inwards towards the bone.
    ! 2 Unlike other areas like the organs in the torso or even the head-face region, limb muscles are an area where the reach of  breath is not easy and evident. However, with diligent practice and study one can learn to get this access especially as part of the tail end of gentle rarified exhalation.
    ! 3 Limb muscles play a crucial role in being able to attain a pose and also to maintain it for further study. If limb muscles are capable, they allow for freedom in taking the load off organs, and even the mind, so that one can focus one’s study in the aspect of interest.    
    11 Spine
    ! 1 Focus on the spine has a great effect and opportunity for study given its position, and association with the organs.
    ! 2 The spine's association with the nerves as well as organs allows distinct mind effects to be engendered and observed, and also emerge spontaneously.
    ! 3 Focus on the spine renders itself both to analytic approach by focusing on different regions separately, as well as holistic focus on spine as a whole.
    ! 4 Focus on spine is a great wide field for breath actions and study.
    ! 5 The spine is locus of nobility, and allows exploration of mindsets from nobility natural to it to utter spinelessness antithetical to it, and energy to tranquility.

_SpinalPart =
    1 Upper Spine
    ! 1 One difficulty in unlocking access to the upper spine is that often the middle, and sometimes the lower spine, will compensate for the stiffness or limitations of the upper spine. It is therefore important to have good control, sensitivity and understanding, to ensure that the upper spine is playing its proper role in an asana.
    ! 2 It is not very easy to gain effective breath-access to the upper spine. So rather than attempt access by sharp or strong breath, one can reach it by fine and rarefied breath.
    ! 3 The upper spine is very closely connected to several parts like shoulders, shoulder-blades, neck and chest. Therefore, focusing action on the upper spine alone is made difficult by the fact that these other parts may come in the way, or sometimes over-participate in actions meant for the upper spine alone.
    ! 4 The upper spine is special in breath and mind effects in that, once one learns to get proper breath access to it, one can gain strength and confidence similar to chest-centric breath without the usually consequent rajasik or ego effects, but rather with the nobility and neutrality that is characteristic of spinal breath.
    2 Middle Spine
    ! 1 The middle spine is very suitable for effecting spinal bending, twisting or elongation. It is also an area for restraint since it has a tendency to unnecessarily compensate for rigidity in lower or upper spine.
    ! 2 The middle spine is close to the diaphragm and this is a great area for expansion of breath and related studies.
    ! 3 The middle spine is close to the diaphragm and an interesting place to focus on abdominal organs. The access is not very direct but the observation is from an interesting vantage point.
    ! 4 The middle spine is often an pass-through area for breath studies. Focus on that area helps device breath modes, graphic modes, and new observations on the regular breath modes.    
    ! 5 Study of spine and mind relation often neglects the middle spine. So focus on the area can provide new insights in this aspect.
    3 Lower Spine
    4 Spine

    ! 4 Focus on spine is a great wide field for breath actions and study.
    ! 5 The spine is locus of nobility, and allows exploration of mindsets from nobility natural to it to utter spinelessness antithetical to it, and energy to tranquility.

_Joints =
    1 Joints
    ! 1 If you observe closely, you find that joints also act as a junction for the flow of awareness. The flow of awareness may stop, or get highly attenuated at a joint so that there is very little flow beyond, or it may even reverse direction on the other side of the joint.
    ! 2 The direction and degree of stretch of muscles on one side of a joint, often has a significant influence on the direction and stretch of muscles on the other side of the joint. Hence it is useful to first configure the joint to attain the necessary muscular stretch and position on either side, before putting it in the final position.
    ! 3 Flexibility and access in joints is essential in being able to strike a pose, so supple movement of joints is important. On the other hand, being able to lock a joint in position is key to be able to stay in a pose, hence being able to lock the joint into its chosen position is also equally important.    
    2 the Shoulder Joints
    3 the Elbow Joints
    4 the Wrist Joint
    ! 1 Though it may not be readily evident, the wrist joint sometimes has a significant role to play in the gesture and culture of the pose. For example, when one jumps with feet apart, and arms outstretched sideways for standing poses, there is a specific soft-yet-firm wrist position and configuration to attain, for the right gesture and culture, for energy flow right up to the fingertips, and so that it is neither dull and tamasic, nor too rajasik.
    ! 2 One thing to note about the wrist joint is the range of movement it supports. Another is how the palm position, stretch of fingers etc. have a great influence on its configuration and suppleness.
    ! 3 In some asanas, the wrist joint has to bear weight. In such cases, subtle adjustments in the area impacts the distribution of weight, thereby affecting the whole asana configuration. This aspect is worth studying.
    ! 4 The wrist joint can be made supple to fully allow energy flow through it. On the other hand, it can be the centre of a lock or mudra acting as a fulcrum point ofr concentration of steadiness and locking of flow. Both these aspects have subtle variations in configuration that are worthy of study.
    5 the Hip Joint
    ! 1 The hip joint has a strong earth-element concentration and does not lend itself to suppleness or for energy flow to smoothly pass through it.
    ! 2 The hip joint has to deal with several configurations of legs, pelvis and spine, and is very accommodating from that point of view. And yet, it is a joint which is not very easy for internal access whether for gross movements or subtle refinements.
    ! 3 The hip joint is critical for most asana positions, and hence attaining an understanding and access to it can have a great impact in improving asanas posturally.
    ! 4 Putting a mudra or a lock / seal at the hip joint is not easy. It may not even be appropriate in many cases and could be problematic. However, due to this very reason, studying the application of a mudra in this location, without going to far with it, can be a source of a lot of learning.

_MindState =
    1 Sattvik Mind
    ! 1 The sattvik mind has qualities of being mild, pleasant, tranquil, pure, virtuous, and yet with an internal unostentatious strength and vigour.
    ! 2 In Indian thought, the qualities of mind such as the Sattvik qualities, are engendered from various things like internal disposition, type of food taken, company kept, lifestyle, self-study and such. Yogasanas in particular, have a great potential to turn out a given mind quality, and hence it is important to understand the interplay of body, breath, mind and senses in yogasanas.
    ! 3 The influence of a sattvik nature of mind goes beyond just mental aspects. Yogasanas are very effective in developing an understanding of that. There is a distinct effect of such a mind on breath and the body, which should be observed. Even seemingly outer or gross (sthula) body parts such as shoulders, arms, thighs etc. can be seen in a sattvik disposition or otherwise.
    ! 4 As per ancient texts, the mental faculty is essential sattvik in its original form. Developing a sattvik mind is a first step in the ultimate stage of discerning the distinction between the chitta and purusha - known as prasankhyana or vivekakhyati.
    2 Rajasik Mind
    ! 1 Rajasik mind comes in many flavours. It could be proud, ambitious, very-purposeful, angry, hyper-active, wavering between two poles etc. It is associated with red colour.
    ! 2 Rajasik mind has its own value especially in the material plane. It helps achieve things and overcome material obstacles through strength and will-power.
    ! 3 Rajasik-ness is never all alone by itself, but along with elements of Sattvik-ness and Tamasik-ness. When focusing on Rajasik-ness we look at its proportion, as well as its change - increase or decrease, in relation to the other two.
    ! 4 Rajasik-ness is a good area of study, especially in its intial stages, since the changes in it due to bodily or breath action is quite easily evident. For example, in many poses, just taking the shoulder-blades in and taking a pronounced inhalation will bring about a visible effect on Rajasik-ness.
    ! 5 Inculcating Rajasik-ness is a useful ability to get oneself out of Tamasik-ness, excessive stupor or delusion. Doing it through bodily and breath actions is a very useful skill for life.    
    3 Tamasik Mind
    ! 1 Tamasik aspect of mind is laziness, inertia, lack of enthusiasm, or totally wrong understanding, strange and invalid notions.
    ! 2 Tamasik aspect of mind is also under significant influence of body state and postures. For example, if chest is collapsed, or the limb muscles are loose, you’ll observe higher tamasik aspect.
    ! 3 Tamasik mind-state also influences and is influenced by the general expressions in the face and eyes. So working on the face and senses via breath, is one direct way to act on the tamasik mind state.
    ! 4 Tamasik mind-state and the state of the organs are also linked. So working on organs in asanas, and accessing them via breath, influences the tamasik mindstate.
    ! 5 Tamasik mind-state is not necessarily only negative. Sometimes there is an advantage of the reduced conscious activity of mind and general dullness, since it lessens direct control over other aspects of the embodiment and they get their own autonomy.

_MindActed = 
    1 Sattvik-ness of Mind
    ! 1 The sattvik mind is pleasant, secure, energetic but with wisdom, and entirely content in the pure self. These aspects are indicative of sattvik-ness.
    ! 2 Sattvik-ness, to some extent, is engendered by conventional means of reading of texts, listening to discourses etc., and yet it needs to be accompanied by the long-lasting organic and intrinsic effects of the kind the yogasanic kriyas can generate.
    ! 3 It is said that sattvik-ness is the essential nature of the mind. This essential nature emerges as the impurities of rajas and tamas are removed. Hence one way of gauging the sattvik-ness is to see how much the rajasik and tamasik tendencies get attenuated.
    2 Rajasik-ness of Mind

_SattvikDetailMind =
    1 Contented-Sattvik Mind
    2 Neutral-Sattvik Mind
    ! 1 An aspect of neutrality very relevant to asana practice is neutrality between ambition and disappointment in terms of the extent of achievement in an asana practice. The neutral mindset strikes a satvik tendency and the asanas are done with the appropriate culture.
    ! 2 A wonderful entity to draw inspiration from, as far as neutrality is concerned, is breath. Unlike the body and mind, the breath is, you'll observe, essentially neutral in its disposition. That is the magic of breath, and one can use its touch to engender its culture within the embodiment.
    ! 3 Neutrality of mind during asana practice refers not only to the conventional mind - the one in the head-brain, but also in every little part of the embodiment. In an asana, each body parts has its own culture. For example, the culture of the chest or the thigh may be one of showing off in some of the back-bend poses. One has to strike neutrality in all these various bodily region, in the flow of breath, and have it seep through to the essential culture of the mind.    
    3 Mild and Pleasant Sattvik Mind
    4 Reflective-Sattvik  Mind

_RajasikDetailMind =
    1 Ambitious-Rajasik Mind State
    ! 1 Ambitious mind gives a great importance to the sense of self, and has a great sense of doership and self-merit. Hence ambition is predominantly a Rajasik attribite. 
    ! 2 Ambition leads to activity. Activity is an essential attribute of Rajasik-ness.
    ! 3 Ambition has a significant desire-component. Hence the mind-state is largely a Rajasik trait.
    2 Proud-Rajasik Mind State
    ! 1 A proud mind-state has a significant component of the sense of self. It is essentially a Rajasik trait.
    ! 2 Pride maybe justified, righteous or otherwise. Since it is primarily constituted of oneself and one's own merits, it is Rajasik in its nature.
    3 HyperActive-Rajasik Mind State
    ! 1 A hyper-active mind is without rest. This constant action and activity is an essentially Rajasik characteristic.
    ! 2 Activity is one of the defining traits of Rajasik-ness. A hyper-active mind chasing one thing or another, whether of a righteous nature or otherwise, has predominantly Rajasik traits.
        
_TamasikDetailMind =
    1 Unwilling-Tamasik Mind
    2 Escapist-Tamasik Mind
    ! 1 A characteristic of Tamas is inertia, indolence and a tendency to shy away and avoid doing that what needs to be done.
    ! 2 An escapist mind seeks reasons to avoid doing what should be done. This is a kind of indolence and also an indicator of the perverse reasoning that is a tamasik characteristic.
    ! 3 Often in practice, one tends to find seemingly sensible reasons to justify not doing what should really be done, or to ignore a mistake because it is convenient. Sometimes, this even happens as a reflex so that there isn't even conscious thought and reasoning around it. All this is an indicator of the tamoguna which veils reality and causes delusion.    
    3 HyperSkeptical-Tamasik Mind
    ! 1 While a questioning and inquisitive mind is conducive to acquiring true knowledge, a hyper-skeptical mind is not quite open to thoughts and ideas. It runs counter to what is required for gaining true knowledge and hence is tamasik in nature.
    ! 2 One of the key attributes in a seeker of knowledge is shraddha - usually rendered in English as faith and steadfastness. A hyper-skeptical mind has the useful quality of a questioning nature, but due to the almost complete lack of shraddha is considered tamasik.
    ! 3 A hyper-skeptical mind tends to believe nothing and question everything. Its observation is keen, is seemingly intelligent, but its reasoning is rather twisted. Hence it is not very suitable for gaining true knowledge, and often is misled through false knowledge, and exhibits clear tamasik attributes.
    
_BreathDescriptor =
    1 _BreathRegion , _BreathDuration , _BreathVolume _BreathComponent
    ! 1 Even though there is pretty much an infinite variety breath, there are some key parameters that can be used to characterise it. Region - the body area such as chest, abdomen etc. where the breath is focused. Duration - the length of time for the breath. Volume - how thick or thin the breath is. The component - inhalation, exhalation, retention (which could be post-inhalative or post-exhalative)
    2 _BreathShape _BreathComponent
    ! 1 There is a concept of breath shape. For example, the breath can be cylindrical, the cylinder could be broad or narrow. The breath can be conical - with the cone pointing upward or downward. The breath can have an elliptical orbit. With skill, several graphic modes and designs can be incorporated. Each of these shapes can be associated with exhalation or inhalation.
    3 _BreathSoundForm _BreathComponent
    ! 1 There is a concept of silently uttering a sound form that has a great influence on the breath. For example, though quite simplified, the a soundform (as in cut) may be found to lead to a normal-sized cylindrical breath, whereas the aa soundform (as in car) will make that cylinder wider. The soundforms not only affect the shape but also the region and volume of breath. This could be done with inhalation, exhalation of both.
    4 _RetentionDescriptor
    ! 1 Even though retention involves cessation of movement of breath, there is a variety in it. The most basic classification, but one very great and evident, is whether the retention is after an inhalation or after an exhalation.
    ! 2 Retention experience varies depending upon the preceeding breath. This is not just about whether the preceeding breath is an inhalation or an exhalation, but also the preceeding breath's region, volume etc.
    ! 3 The basic ways to characterise retention are; the specifics of the preceeding breath, the duration of retention, and the focus in terms of the bodily region during the retention.

_BreathRegion =
    1 Chest-Region
    2 Head and Face-Region
    ! 1 The Head and Face Region is conducive to the softer, more delicate and sensitive breath. It has profound effects on the mind aspects.
    ! 2 The Head and Face Region breath is special because the co-location of the senses in this area. So special focus on one or more senses - the eyes, the nose, the mouth, the ears, the skin, and how breath interacts with them, is a wonderful field of observations and effects.
    ! 3 The Head and Face region breath needs to be properly deployed due to its dramatic effects on the mind. Having soft, delicate, and caressing breath can soothe the mind, but wrongly deployed breath could also increase agitation and tension. Similarly, breath channeled towards the back of the head/brain has a more inwardly action than the breath channeled to the front. Even though the region is small, the effects are varied, and hence proper care and study is required.    
    3 Nose-Region
    4 Spinal-Region
    ! 1 In terms of the location, spinal-region breath takes the breathing further back and dorsal-wards, and in an area around the vertical center. 
    ! 2 Breath in the spinal-region can be deployed either as though it is running through the spine, or as though it is running around the spine outside yet near it on all sides.
    ! 3 While spinal-region breath implies breath focused on the entire length of the spine, one may also deploy it in just the upper, middle or lower spine, either as an initial step, or as an area of specific focus.
    ! 4 Focus on the spinal-region has a mindstate effect of instating what is known in sanskrit as sheelam, which can loosely be translated as noble character - the opposite of spinelessness. And if this focus is through breath, the effect is multi-fold due to the inerent power of breath over mind state.
    ! 5 There isn't just one way to deploy breath focused on the spinal-region. In particular, the same may be done in many of the so-called graphic modes of breath eg. cylindrical, cyclical, conical, repeated cones etc.    
    ! 6 The spine is the very center of the nervous system. Breath that is focused on spine, invigorates the region and one can see the effect on the mindstate in terms of heightened mental awareness as well as poise.
    5 Pelvic-Region
    6 Abdominal-Region
    ! 1 The abdominal region is among the most effective regions for breath action, even more than the more-often emphasized chest region.
    ! 2 The abdominal region is one of the main centres of body chemistry, and the effect of conscious breath focus in that region can have amplified effects.
    ! 3 The abdominal region is very conducive for breath focus, because the available access to it, and the range of actions that can be done - during exhalation, retention as well as exhalation.
    ! 4 The abdominal region is a key area for kriyas like the Uddiyana kriya, and hence a very effective area for breath focus.
    

_BreathDuration =
    1 Long-duration
    2 Short-duration
    ! 1 Short duration breath is not an obvious choice for breath focus, but perhaps due to that, it allows certain key observations that may not be available otherwise.
    ! 2 Short duration breath is more conducive to activity than to passivity. You can observe the effects on mind and the pose, as this motivates more actions than repose.
    ! 3 Short duration breath, may be found to be more conducive as a preparatory for exercise than for deeper study purposes.

_BreathVolume =
    1 Large-volume
    ! 1 Large volume breath involves passage of a large amount of air as though through a large pipe. This does not have a bearing on the duration or frequency of breath.
    ! 2 Large volume breath is conducive to broad access to the embodiment via breath as it travels through the body in exhalation or inhalation.
    ! 3 Large volume breath is also interesting for observation of associated retention wherein the large volume is dissipated to bring in emptiness.
    ! 4 Large volume breath is more natural to certain asanas than others. Observing how to deploy large volume breath in various asanas helps a better understanding of asanas.

    ! 2 The state of a region as a result of post-exhalative retention involves total stillness, seemingly no other influence but that of gravity. It is one where that region can be studied in its essential form.
    ! 3 The state of post-exhalative retention is wondrous by virtue of the fact that there is complete evacuation and the region is in its most essential state, and yet staying in that state for a long time is not an easily acquired skill. So it is important to note how long one can effectively be in that state, and carry out necessary observations and experiments within that time.

_RetentionDescriptor = 
    1 Retention
    ! 1 Retention is a marvellous state, and somewhat unique to yogic studies. There is complete stillness with remnants of previous breath still lingering.
    ! 2 Even though retention is a state of cessation in breath, it does not necessarily preclude bodily activity. This can be brought about with things like uddiyana kriya in different regions.
    ! 3 One can feel the difficulty in continuing a chain of thought while in retention due to the graivty towards complete stillness. This gives a clue to the link between mind and breath.
    2 Retention after Exhalation
    ! 1 For beginning studies in retention, observing retention after exhalation is the best mode. In this state, the organs are in a state without strain, and it is more amenable to retention and the study of it and its effects.
    ! 2 When working with retention after exhalation, the exhalation is to be done in a way such as to affect evacuation. The organs are then in their own natural state. In fact, if one can then perform retention and keep it for a while, one can experience a certain sattva seeping into the organs as a result of the evacuation and retention, and the organs being in a natural state without any strain.
    ! 3 When one employs retention after a complete exhalation, the mind state is also worth observing. One will find a certain stillness of the mind, which is yet highly aware and sensitive to the internal body and organs.
    ! 4 When observing retention after exhalation along with its effects, one needs to be careful that the subsequent inhalation begins smoothly with no jolt or rush of the inhalation action.
    3 Retention after Exhalation and followed by Suction
    4 Retention after Inhalation
    ! 1 To a lay person or beginner, when talking about retention, it is retention after inhalation that seems more intuitive or natural. However, for one initiated in yogic practices, retention after exhalation is a better initiation into the art since it involves lower strain, greater access and scope for deeper insights.
    ! 2 Retention after inhalation, once someone has learnt it, is effective in building greater strength and power. It does involve greater strain and needs to be done carefully, and so one can start with smaller duration and gradually increase over time. The preceeding inhalation can also be made more voluminous as one grows in skill.
    ! 3 When practising retention after inhalation, it is not necessary that the preceeding inhalation be a full inhalation. Similarly the inhalation need not flow the entire length from the bottom to the top, and one can initially have lower volume and limited regional confinement for the preceding inhalation, and increase that once they learn further.    
    
    
_BreathActed =
    1 Penetration of Breath
    2 Constancy of Breath-cycle
    ! 1 Breath has many parameters that characterises it, such as the volume, duration and region. A breath-cycle has further parameters such as its shape and trajectory, and how it transitions over time and from inhalation to exhalation and vice versa. Constancy in a breath-cycle involves recognizing these characteristics and maintain them unchanging.
    ! 2 Once a breath-cycle is established, its constancy may be achieved through constant attention and effort, or on the other hand just naturally by maintaining the pose and state. Different asanas, states of body and mind, and levels of practitioners may require different approaches.
    ! 3 Once a breath-cycle is established, the slightest disturbance in any body-region, or in breath aspect or mind aspect, affects the constancy of the breath-cycle. However, you will observe that the constancy is affected to different extents depending on the nature of the disturbance. A close study of this aspect, helps us learn about how much a certain region or a certain component has an impact on the overall breath cycle.
    ! 4 Different asanas have a different breath-cycle profile that is more natural to maintain constant. Observing this helps us learn about the asana.    
    3 Smoothness of Breath
    4 Frequency/duration of Breath
    ! 1 Frequency/duration of breath is purely about the time involved in a breath cycle. With the same frequency, you may have a different volumes - thick and thin breath, as well as different breath regions and shapes.
    ! 2 When we say frequency/duration of breath it implies that the duration for inhalation and exhalation is the same; but in reality, there can be further variation within a frequency by spending different amounts of time in inhalation, exhalation, and even retention.
    ! 3 Different frequencies/duration of breath have different effects on the body - whether the skeleto-muscular body part or the organic system, as well as different and quite discernible effects on the mind-states. At the same time, different asanas, body parts and aspects, as well as mind-states, have their own natural frequency/duration of breath.    
    5 Predominant Region of Breath    
    
_TimeRelation =     
    1 after
    ! 1 When associating breath with action, recognizing what kind of breath is appropriate is a skill that must be developed. Some actions may require a sharp exhalation in the region along with the quick action, while another may require a steady inhalation along with gradual action. To develop a sense of this, a good way is to actually deploy different kinds of breath in that region for the same action, and observed the effects closely. 
    ! 2 The point after a breath stage is characteristically different depending on which breath stage it is, as well as the parameters of that breath such as region, duration, volume etc. For example, at the point after inhalation in a region it is as though that region is Filled Up, whereas after exhalation it is Fully Evacuated, and after retention it is even further evacuated and in a not-easy-to-describe state ready for the next stage.
    ! 3 There is quite some skill involved even in recognizing at what point at certain breath stage has ended, and making sure that there is no further activity with regard to that breath stage, so that the point can be characterised as one after the breath stage. Once that point is identified, the subsequent action can follow, which is the one being planned to be executed after that breath stage.

    1 Separate your 'I' from them, and observe them from the outside to develop witnessivity and non-attachment
    2 Separate your 'I' from them, and work on identifying and studying the 'I' as separate from them
    ! 1 If you observe, the sense of 'I' is a phenomenal one. Sometimes it may be associated with body-conditions, sometimes with mind-state, and even sometimes with circumstances (eg. how close friends think of us). The closest association is with the state of the mind and buddhi. However, when one observes the mind and buddhi as an object, it helps recognize that the 'I' is still something different from them, and this realization has the potential to change one's practice, way of thinking and dealing with the world.
    ! 2 When one considers the mind and buddhi as an object, there is a growing identification of the 'I' as separate from them. One of the key recongnitions in the endeavour is that, when one sees a change in body or mind, one makes it part of the object of observation - the mind, buddhi or body. And hence it appears that all changes are elsewhere and not in the 'I', which is a small beginning step in identifying one's true I-ness and recognizing pure witnessivity.
    ! 3 The endeavour of separating the phenomenal 'I' from manas and buddhi, body and circumstances, leads slowly to an organic realization of how one so frequently lets external circumstances influence the feeling of self, making one feel tiredness, anger, exsaperation, pride, happiness etc.; whereas in reality those are simply effects on objects such as the body and mind. The effect of this realization lingers beyond the particular yoga practice done in this mode, to have a transformational effect on general life dealings - for short periods of time in the beginning, but for greater lasting periods eventually.

    3 Back-knee-to-hips i.e. Back-thigh Area
    4 Root of the Thigh i.e. Hip Area
    5 Hip-to-Spine i.e Lower Back Area
    ! 1 The hip-to-spine connection is among the most important yet most complex for most asanas. There is great range of configurations from loosening, tightening, widening, forward beds, backward bends, twists to various eka-pada configurations. And yet, thinking of that as a rubber-band helps act on it in the pose with effectiveness and simplicity.
    ! 2 The hip-to-spine area is also one with large variations across individuals. So each person needs to understand their own areas of tightness, flexibility, and structural characteristics. Focusing on that with a simple rubber-band model in different poses, helps one understand the key to unlocking the region which can enable many other asanas too.
    ! 3 The hip-to-spine region is not one with easy access to breath. And yet, co-ordinating and deploying breath in its study brings benefit. To begin with, use evacuation by rarefied exhalation and take advantage of the period after the end of exhalation before the next inhalation starts, to gain freedom and release in the region.

    ! 1 The shoulder and shoulder-blade area is different from other areas as far as the muscular actions are concerned. Most of the movement is not along the so-called elastic band, but rather in the transverse direction.
    ! 2 The key focus for muscular movement for the shoulder and shoulder blade area would be the contraction along the width at one end (on the back side, say), and the expansion on the other side (the chest side).
    ! 3 Though it may at first appear that the should blades and shoulder area actions for muscular are only along the width of the elastic band and not the length, one can notice that the subtler actions run along the length of it. The combination of these two make a good area for study.

_UddiyanaDesc = 
    1 Along-with-Inhalation
    ! 1 Uddiyana kriya along with inhalation involves the suction action in the chosen region as the breath is slowly drawn in for inhalation.
    ! 2 Uddiyana kriya along inhalation feels like the breath is penetrating into the flesh and organs, and combing, scraping and cleaning through them. The suction action involves a flattening of the region and the clustering of the organs together.
    ! 3 Uddiyana kriya done along with inhalation requires a significant amount of internal strength and power. This kriya gives a feeling of energising from the inside, along with a kind of vigorous cleansing.    
    2 Post-Inhalation
    ! 1 Uddiyana kriya post-inhalation involves inhaling to the chosen extent, and then performing a pronounced suction action and holding it with retention.
    ! 2 Uddiyana kriya post-inhalation requires one to draw in the breath past the chosen region for suction, and further upward. This is followed by performing the suction action during retention. The retention and suction is in a state of high internal energy owing to inhalation, with the chest region expanded and taut. Hence the uddiyana kriya may feel like receiving some resistance, and yet there is high alertness.
    ! 3 Uddiyana kriya post-inhalation gives inner bodily vigour and strength, definitely from within but also in the peripheral body. Since the air is drawn in due to inhalation, holding the retention is not straightforward, and additionally doing and holding the suction requires inner and outer strength. However, one must learn to avoid strain, and do this only after a certain level of proficiency and comfort is gained.    
    3 Along-with-Exhalation
    ! 1 Uddiyana kriya along with exhalation involves the suction action in the chosen region as the breath is slowly led out during exhalation.
    ! 2 Uddiyana kriya along exhalation feels like a controlled and gradual deflation with breath taking out all the impurities as it seeps out of the inner organs. The suction action accompanies the breath as it goes out and brings about a deep purifying effect.
    ! 3 Uddiyana kriya done along with exhalation gives great inner access to the organs in the region of the kriya. This mode of the kriya is most suited to start learning the uddiyana kriya.    
    4 Post-exhalation
    ! 1 Uddiyana kriya after exhalation involves the suction action in the chosen region with a retention that follows a complete evacuating exhalation.
    ! 2 Uddiyana kriya after exhalation is the quintessential mode of the kriya. One needs to learn the full exhalation and holding the retention without an urge to inhale. The suction feels as though a wringing of the inner body and organs to flush out all impurities.
    ! 3 Uddiyana kriya after exhalation gives total evacuation, and an internally generated purity and great lightness. The flushing-out and purifying happens not only in the trunk region, but also in the brain and mind.

    3 Mind
    ! 1 Mind is one of the key components of an asana. Just like we make actions using the body, and look at effects on the body, similarly, the same is applicable to the mind, and perhaps even more so.
    ! 2 There are various ways to characterise mind. One way is to use terms related to emotional states - angry, tired, happy, enthusiastic, confused etc. The other is from the perspective of intelligence and rational aspects - mature, sage-like, child-like, logical/illogical, strong etc. The other is to use broad categories of sattva, raja, tama, and then use finer aspects within each to categorise the state of mind.
    ! 3 Mind has a volitional / will-power aspect, a receiving / sensitive aspect, an observational / experiencing aspect, and a thinking analytical aspect, as well as a creative aspect. Each of these aspects are directly applicable to asana practice, and observing this closely can develop key insights and wisdom.
    ! 4 Mind states directly influence breath, and can also get influenced by it. Similarly mind directly influences the body and gets influenced by it. The details of these interactions and influences in the various asanas are very worth of study.
    ! 5 Mind is well-known as something hard to control. Bhagavad Gita makes explicit mention of this. Study of asanas can help one learn how to overcome this. Oftentimes such control or regulation may be made possible by effective use of breath and body, rather than by the mind itself.

_EmanationConvergence = 
    1 Emanating from that region
    ! 1 When you work on having action and awareness emanate from a single area, it is like you are working from the hub to the edge of spokes. This is usually easier than the other way around. The key is to learn how to emanate in all directions rather than narrowing focus only to certain directions.    
    ! 2 Action and awareness emanating all over the embodiment from a central place is rather different from correcting one area then another. This approach gives a feel of connectedness and expansiveness, with the focus area at the center of action and awareness.    
    ! 3 Even though we say action is emanating from a single focus-point, it doesn’t mean there is a constant movement of action and awareness from that point. One initiates action and awareness ffrom the focus-point, and once that is established, the embodiment seems to be expansive, single-purposed and connected.    
    2 Converging into that region
    ! 1 When you work on having action and awareness converge to a single area, it is like you are working from the edge of spokes to the hub. This is not so easy. You can start with only some spokes first, and then expand your coverage so that you eventually circumscribe the embodiment to have the awareness converge from all sides into the region of focus.
    ! 2 Action and awareness converging in from all over the embodiment into a central place is rather different from correcting one area then another, or from having awareness radiate out from one place to the entire embodiment. This direction from the outside to a single focus point, brings in an aspect of compactness, connectedness, and boundedness.
    ! 3 Even though we say action is converging to a single focus-point, it doesn’t mean there is a constant movement of action and awareness towards that point. One could also initiate action and awareness from the periphery in all directions to a single focus-point, and once the convergence has happened, remain in that state of converged awareness. In this state, the embodiment seems to be more bounded, compact, homogenous, circumscribed and densely-connected.    
    3 First Emanating from that region , and then separately, Converging into that region

You can start with only some spokes first, and then expand your coverage so that you eventually circumscribe the embodiment to have the awareness converge from all sides into the region of focus.
    ! 5 Action and awareness converging in from all over the embodiment into a central place is rather different from correcting one area then another, or from having awareness radiate out from one place to the entire embodiment. This direction from the outside to a single focus point, brings in an aspect of compactness, connectedness, and boundedness.
    ! 6 Even though we say action is converging to a single focus-point, it doesn’t mean there is a constant movement of action and awareness towards that point. One could also initiate action and awareness from the periphery in all directions to a single focus-point, and once the convergence has happened, remain in that state of converged awareness. In this state, the embodiment seems to be more bounded, compact, homogenous, circumscribed and densely-connected.

_EyeRegion =
    1 Front of the Eyes
    ! 1 When breath and awareness are in the front of the eyes, one is steady and unwavering. And yet, it is not a mode where one is withdrawn or philosophical, but instead, very much in the present, alert, yet steady and confident.
    ! 2 When awareness via breath is in the front of the eyes, one is more outwardly disposed, ready to face circumstances with a steady mind. This mode gives internal strength, with steady and quiet mind, which is yet alert. So this is still steadiness, but not meditative steadiness.
    ! 3 When awareness is to be brought to the front of the eyes, one must attempt it with rarefied breath without causing strain in the eyes by attempting to open it too wide. One attains a calm and confident mental demeanour with awareness positioned as such.	
    2 Back of the Eyes
    ! 1 When breath and awareness is at the back of the eyes, one gets an almost completely inwardly and philosophical aspect. The eyes are seeing yet unseeing. The mind is steady and almost disappearing.
    ! 2 When one learns to take one's awareness to the back of the eyes and have a steady silent breath with mind completely passive, one observes that the facial muscles automatically relax and attain a configuration that automatically leads to a seemingly beatific smile.
    ! 3 To take ones awareness towards the back of the eyes, one must first learn to deploy more and more rarefied breath with awareness going towards the back of the eyes. Conscious activity should recede on its own, and the mind goes quite and inwardly, and gradually disappearing. Note that doing this does not involve moving the eyeballs and should cause no strain whatsoever.	
    3 Top of the Eyes
    ! 1 Having breath and awareness on the top of the eyes helps to steady and still the mind. One might notice that this is not so much about passivity and inwardliness, but more of an alert state with elimination of wandering and distraction, and elimination of strain and tension.
    ! 2 When bringing awareness on top of the eyes, it is very important to note that that does not imply actually moving the eyes or eyeballs upward. Doing that can lead to a certain strain. The eyes remain in a comfortable centered position, but it is the awanress that moves upward. To start with it is best done in association with rarefied exhalation.
    ! 3 The practice of these methods develops skills that can be valuable even in day to day life. For example, if a mind is wandering, one can use their learning of these techniques to steady the mind while still maintaining the full capacity to engage in work and activity - as opposed to steadiness for sake of inwardliness and meditativity.    
    4 Bottom of the Eyes    
    ! 1 Having breath and awareness on the bottom of the eyes, brings in quietness and restfulness to the mind. Although it brings about a silent quietness, it is interesting in that, it does not go the whole length in terms of engendering a philosophical inwardly mind.
    ! 2 Breath and awareness on the bottom of the eyes, brings in a certain seeming wet nourishing in the eyes that has a refreshing effect on the mindstate. This is interesting and somewhat unique to this area of awareness.
    ! 3 In general, having awareness and breath on a certain region of the eye, does not mean actually moving the eye or eyeball in that direction. However, in case of awareness on the bottom of the eyes, one can actually lower the eyeballs towards that, and observe the effect of doing that too.    
    5 Outer Corners of the Eyes
    ! 1 Having breath awareness on the outer corner of the eyes, brings a certain type of quietness of the mind, like the expansive steadiness of the ocean.
    ! 2 Awareness on the outer corners of the eyes, brings about a widening of the mind, that is as though all-encompassing in its purview and brings about a stable steady state. You might find that the facial muscles relax into a state that brings an automatic beatific mild smile and expression.
    ! 3 When having awareness on the outer corners of the eyes, one has the breath, particularly rarefied exhalation to begin with, and awareness in the region. Note that it is not that the eyes or eyeballs move outward - the eyes remain in the center, but the awareness is on the outer corners.    
    6 Inner Corners of the Eyes
    ! 1 Having breath and awareness on the inner corners of the eyes brings about a certain narrowed concentration or focus. Knowledge of this is valuable in case one wants to make use of this in order to generates such a mindset.
    ! 2 One might have noticed a narrowing of eyes and focus on inner corners, one is thinking hard on a specific problem like a methematical problem. This tells us how this involvement of sense awareness with the mindstate also happens naturally on its own.
    ! 3 It is important to note that focusing awareness on the inner corner of the eyes does not mean actually moving the eye or eyeball. It is only about the awareness, which is best done in the beginning with a rarefied exhalative breath and associated awareness in that region.

_NoseRegion =
    1 Side Edges of Nose and Nostrils
    ! 1 Awareness and breath on the side edges of the nose and nostrils requires a certain gentleness and delicacy of breath. This is one mode where the touch and even the sound of breath is hardly perceptible anymore.
    ! 2 When the breath and awareness is on the side edges of the nose and nostrils, there is a unique sensation of a certain lightness as though all the weight and solidity has been taken away from the breath, body and mind.
    ! 3 Awareness and breath on the side edges of nose and nostrils has a effect of relaxation in the eyes and the facial muscles, and the conscious mind becomes less conspicuous and goes into a restful state.
    2 Inner / Center Edge of Nose and Nostrils
    3 Top Edge of Nose and Nostrils
    4 Bottom Edge of Nose and Nostrils
    ! 1 THe bottom edge of nose and nostrils refers the lower part of the nose joins with the face. You may observe that when bringing awareness and breath to this region properly, the facial muscles around that area soften, leading to an automatic expression of a mild smile, which in itself is a reflection of the mind state engendered.
    ! 2 One may find that bringing breath and awareness at the bottom edge of the nose and nostrils, not only has an effect on that region and on the mind, but also on its own leads to a softening, drawing in and lowering of the eyes. Moreover, to have the awareness on that area and not stray from it, even the chest happens to be raised a certain amount, and the shoulder-blades correspondingly drawn in as though by themselves. This disposition of the eyes and orientation of the chest is an indication of the mild, pleasant and yet upright mind state natural to this kriya.
    ! 3 This area of the bottom edge of the nost and nostrils, is a very specific one with other regions very close to it. So bringing awareness to this region needs sensitivity to subtleties, and that requires very gentle and rarefied breath. You may observe that this region brings about a mild and pleasant disposition of mind, which is a sattvik characteristic, along with a certain still, steady quietude.
    5 Center Hollow of Nose and Nostrils
    ! 1 Breath and awareness in the center hollow of the nose and nostriles has an effect of concentration and centering as opposed to an expansive effect.
    ! 2 For breath and awareness to be in the center hollow of the nose and nostrils the breath needs to be low in volume, though it can be low or high in velocity depending on the specific effect of exploration being undertaken.
    ! 3 The process and effect of having breath and awareness in the center hollow of the nose and nostrils is closer to the so-called normal breathing, compared to other areas of breath and awareness focussed upon in the study of the senses in asanas.
    ! 4 To have the breath and awareness in the center hollow of the nose and nostrils, one needs to be mindful to take care that the breath and awareness does not veer away from there, since the other regions of the nose relevant to the study of senses are in quite close proximity. At this same time, when taking this care, if one finds it getting strenuous, it is better to stop, let go, and resume at a later time.
