<h1> About Prashnayantra: A Yogasana Problem Statement Generator </h1>
<p>
23 Feb 2014
<p>
Beginners focus on learning how to do asanas, and improving their poses over time. At some point however,
you need to go beyond this, and slowly embark on a study of yogic principles. This project auto-generates problem statements
that are intended to help in this journey.
<p>
These problem statements are based primarily on classes conducted in the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute, Pune, and particularly
from attending classes conducted by Prashant Iyengar.
<p>
Stepping into the ladder towards yogic principles, I would say that the level of problem statements generated here is still near the initial steps.
There are higher, subtler principles and lessons that
go beyond those addressed in the problem statements here. For example, Prana-kriya, Chakra-kriya, Pranayama etc.
are not covered here.
<p>
The problem statements generated here will make most sense to those who attend the classes cited above. While others may yet benefit 
from them, they may not be able to appreciate them in the same sense. This unfortunately,
is true of any somewhat specialized subject that has not yet built a formal widely-accepted jargon, but has developed
specific terms used by teachers. At this point, I do not aim to provide an explanation of each of the problem
statements, and nor am I fully equipped to do that.
<p>
<h2> How to Use </h2>
<p>
Those that attend the classes will realize that the problem statements generated here have tremendous potential
to raise the level of students who use them in their practices. This project may help students get a grip on
the many topics, paradigms and principles covered informally in classes, but that slip away from their minds
over time.
<p>
Teachers may use these problem statements for their own study from a teaching point of view, or even just
to help come up with a topic to cover in their next class.
<p>
Classes could use this to put up on a &quot Thought for the Week &quot type notice board.
<p>
It'd be great to have a community of students that work on these problem statements, share their notes, and learn together.
Maybe an online community too.
<p>
<h2> This Project </h2>
<p>
Other than just being somewhat fun and interesting, I believe there is value in this project in that, the listing and systemetization
of various informally taught, but as yet uncataloged, lessons and principles, in the form of the 
grammar used to generate the problem statements.
<p>
<h2> Caveats </h2>
<p>
Some auto-generated problem statements may seem non-sensical. The fault lies entirely with me (I probably let something slip through to simplify the grammar).
At the same time, what may sound non-sensical to one, may well be deep and insightful to a more penetrating mind...
